# Uvira 200-plex Luminex QC — To-Do & Session Log

Working document tracking the migration of the MPXV 12-plex MagPix QC app to a
200-plex Intelliflex assay (Uvira pilot). Keep the **To-Do** section as the
running plan and append a new entry under **Session History** at the end of
every working session.

---

## Project context (snapshot)

- **Instrument**: Intelliflex (replaces MagPix). xPONENT CSV format is similar
  but has an expanded `DataType:` set (Median, Mean, Count, %CV, Peak, Std Dev,
  Trimmed Peak / SD / Mean, Net MFI, Avg Net MFI, Units, Dilution Factor).
  Header lines differ: `"Program","xPONENT","","Intelliflex"`, `SN` like
  `IFLEXP23263001`, `PanelName` (e.g. `XXL_CORRECTED [v1]`), no per-row
  bead-number prefix on analyte names.
- **Plate format**: 96-well. Row A wells A1–A10 hold the 10-point 4-fold
  standard curve; A11–A12 are backgrounds/NC. B1 onward are specimens
  (barcodes like `FD22124871`). See `Pilot_Uvira_XXL/…_inputfile.csv` for the
  authoritative layout (`Location, Plate Type, Type, Description, Dilution`).
- **Standards**: pooled standard with mAbs. Pool composition:
  - Standards: Zika 16/352, Diphtheria 10/262, Hep B surface 07/164,
    Mpox MP-001 (in-house), P. vivax 19/198, Rift Valley 22/104BA,
    Rubella RUBI-1-94, Yellow Fever YF, HPV18 10/140.
  - mAbs: HylE, ctxB, OSP.
- **Dilution series** (from screenshot): mAbs pre-diluted 1:50, then 4-fold
  serial. Final dilutions for the Std+Mabs row:
  62.5, 250, 1000, 4000, 16000, 64000, 256000, 1024000, 4096000, 16384000.
  Well volume 5 µL. First dilution recipe: `5 µL MAbs + 11.8 PBT (+3.2 Stds
  pool)`; proceeding dilutions: `5 pool + 15 PBT`.
- **Antigen panel**: ~200 antigens listed in the Median header of
  `PlateRunResults_PLATE_05112026_RUN000.csv` (row 52). Includes families
  RES_, TOXO_, VPD_, HHV_, BAC_, OTH_, ENT_, HEP_, ARB_, STI_, MAL_, CHO_,
  CTRL_, NTD_, HCoV_, SARS_, TBD_, FLU_, POX_, HAN_.
- **Erroneous bead regions to flag/drop**:
  `FLU_B_HA_Maryland_1959`, `FLU_B_NP_Brisbane_2008`, `VPD_Tet_tox`.
- **Barcode → patient-ID maps**: 22 xlsx files in
  `Renamed_Uvira_Sera_2023_Barcode_maps/`. Each has a single sheet with
  columns `Container Id, Orientation Barcode, Row, Column, Barcode, Scan
  Time, Filename, Automatic Export Directory, ID` — the `Barcode` column
  matches the `Description` field of the inputfile; `ID` is the patient ID
  (e.g. `4033-93`).

## What the existing app already provides (reuse vs. replace)

| Capability | Reuse? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `parse_xponent.py` CSV parser | **Edit** | Works on MagPix shape; Intelliflex header keys differ slightly and there are more `DataType:` blocks. The `01 MVA Ag` numeric-prefix strip is a no-op here. Plate-ID extraction regex (`(.+-Plate\d+)`) won't match `PLATE_05112026_RUN000` → needs new rule. |
| `classify.py` PC/NC patterns | **Edit** | New sample names are `Standard1…Standard10`, `Background`, and `FD########` barcodes. Pool concept (`ITM PC` vs `ITM PC2`) does not apply — single pooled standard. |
| `qc_beads.py` (bead-count flag) | **Reuse + extend** | Already flags `count < min`. Needs the 3-tier (red/yellow/green) table the user requested, plus a problem-sample list. |
| `qc_standard_curve.py` 4PL fitting | **Reuse** | Per-antigen 4PL is the right shape; just runs over ~200 antigens × 1 pool instead of 8 × 2 pools. Add the "% samples in linear range" metric and a per-(antigen, sample) IN/OUT-of-range table. |
| `qc_kit_controls.py`, `qc_nc.py`, `qc_replicates.py` | **Defer / probably drop** | The new assay has no MagPix kit-control beads (NC/ScG/FC/IC bead regions); NC is the row-A backgrounds. PC replicate CV does not apply (single replicate per dilution point in row A). |
| `report.py` / `templates/report.html` | **Edit heavily** | Layout assumes 8 antigens (2×4 grids). Needs to scale to 200 (paginated / filterable / searchable). New bead-count table and IN/OUT-of-range table go here. |
| `config.py`, `settings.py` | **Edit** | Panel definition, kit-control list, default thresholds, well-classification patterns all hard-coded for 12-plex MPXV. |
| `parse_layout.py` | **Edit** | Currently reads a Geneva "Sample list" xlsx. New flow joins the Intelliflex `inputfile.csv` (well → barcode) with one of the Box barcode-map xlsx files (barcode → patient ID). |
| `qc_history.py` / per-pool history JSON | **Keep, simplify** | Drop the multi-pool slug logic; one history per assay. |

## To-Do

Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked.

### 0. Project setup
- [x] Create this tracking doc (`UVIRA_TODO.md`).
- [x] Decision: **single-mode app** — Uvira 200-plex Intelliflex only. The
      existing MPXV 12-plex MagPix code path will be removed. No assay
      selector; the pipeline replaces (not augments) the current one.
- [x] Strip MPXV-specific code. `MPXV_ANTIGENS` / `MPXV_KIT_CONTROLS`
      shims were removed in Session 4. `qc_kit_controls.py` and
      `qc_replicates.py` were deleted in Session 4; `qc_nc.py` was
      rewritten in Session 5 for the new NC concept (not the
      MagPix kit-bead). `report.py` and `templates/report.html`
      were rewritten end-to-end in Sessions 4–10. Legacy descriptive
      copy in README / SPEC rewritten in Session 9.
- [x] Rename app branding (window title, report title, settings page,
      results-dir name, download filenames, README/SPEC headers) from
      "MPXV Luminex QC" to "Uvira Luminex QC". Package import path
      stays `src/`. `RESULTS_DIR_NAME = "uvira-luminex-qc-results"` now
      lives in `config.py` and is consumed by `app.py` + `settings.py`.
- [x] Bumped `APP_VERSION` to `0.9.0-uvira`.

### 1. Data ingestion
- [x] Extend `parse_xponent.py` to handle Intelliflex headers. Captures
      `instrument_program` (MagPix / Intelliflex), `panel_name`,
      `batch_description`, `batch_stop_time`. Metadata scan now stops at
      the first `DataType:` row. Smoke-tested on
      `PlateRunResults_PLATE_05112026_RUN000.csv`: 200 analytes × 96
      wells parsed cleanly, batch / SN / panel name all captured. The
      existing `_strip_bead_prefix` regex is a no-op for unprefixed
      Intelliflex analyte names.
- [x] New plate-ID rule. `_extract_plate_id` falls back to the raw
      batch string when the legacy `-Plate\d+` regex doesn't match, so
      Intelliflex batches like `PLATE_05112026_RUN000` are used verbatim
      as the plate ID.
- [x] Replaced `parse_layout.py` with `read_inputfile_csv()`,
      `read_box_xlsx()`, and `build_layout()` (a unified well-level join
      that produces `well, plate_well_type, barcode, patient_id, box_id,
      source_row, source_col`). `read_plate_layout()` retained as a
      backward-compat wrapper. Smoke-tested on the pilot data: 84/84
      specimens get a patient ID; the 12 control wells correctly have
      empty barcodes.
- [x] Extended the Flask upload form to accept three files (plate CSV
      [required], inputfile CSV [optional but recommended], Box xlsx
      [optional]). All three are persisted to `uploads/` and tracked in
      `plate_registry.json` (new `inputfile_filename` field) so
      Regenerate-All works without re-upload. `run_pipeline` now takes
      `inputfile_path`; when provided it routes through `build_layout`
      and writes `sample_id` (patient_id if known, else barcode),
      `barcode`, `patient_id`, `box_id` onto each row.
- [x] **Soft-flag** the three erroneous bead regions
      (`FLU_B_HA_Maryland_1959`, `FLU_B_NP_Brisbane_2008`, `VPD_Tet_tox`):
      data side done in Section 2 (`EXCLUDED_ANALYTES` /
      `panel.excluded_analytes` in `config.py`, surfaced via
      `get_excluded_analytes()` in `settings.py`). Render side
      shipped in Sessions 4–5: excluded rows are visually muted in
      every table, italicised in axis tick labels, and listed in the
      Plate Overview banner.

### 2. Config & panel definition
- [x] Replaced `MPXV_ANTIGENS` / `MPXV_KIT_CONTROLS` with the 200 Uvira
      antigens (`ANTIGENS` constant in `config.py`). Old names retained
      as deprecated aliases.
- [x] Panel auto-derived from each CSV's Median-block header on
      ingest. `parse_xponent_csv` records `metadata['analytes']`;
      `pipeline.py` passes that list as the authoritative panel into
      `fit_standard_curves(antigens=...)`. Config panel is now a
      display-only fallback.
- [x] `excluded_analytes` is editable from the Settings page (textarea,
      one analyte per line). Defaults to the three erroneous bead
      regions. Surfaced on the per-(antigen × sample) range table via
      the `excluded` column.
- [x] Updated `well_classification` patterns to `^Standard\d+$` /
      `^Background`.
- [x] Standard dilution series baked into defaults (10-point 4-fold
      from 62.5 → 16,384,000); editable on the Settings page as a
      single comma-separated field (the old auto/manual mode toggle was
      removed because Intelliflex never encodes dilutions in sample
      names).

### 3. Standard-curve QC (200 antigens)
- [x] Existing 4PL per-antigen fit reused. `fit_standard_curves` now
      takes an `antigens` kwarg so the pipeline passes the per-plate
      panel from the CSV header. Pool concept collapses to a single
      `"PC"` key on Uvira (the multi-pool branch is unused but kept
      for backward compat).
- [x] **New metric** `compute_pct_in_range_per_antigen(in_range, ...)`
      returns one row per analyte with `n_samples / n_in_range /
      n_out_of_range / n_no_fit / pct_in_range / excluded`. Exported
      as `pct_in_range_<plate>.csv`.
- [x] **New table** `compute_in_range_table(data, fits, excluded)`
      returns one row per (specimen well × analyte) with `mfi /
      mfi_lloq / mfi_uloq / status / excluded` plus any sample-id /
      barcode / patient-id columns from the layout merge. Status is
      strictly `IN_RANGE` / `OUT_OF_RANGE` / `NO_FIT`; below-LLOQ and
      above-ULOQ both collapse to OUT_OF_RANGE per decision #3.
      Exported as `in_range_<plate>.csv`. Smoke-test on the pilot data:
      16,800 rows (84 specimens × 200 antigens), the three excluded
      bead regions came back at 0–3.6% in-range as expected.
- [x] Curve-plot picker shipped — single Plotly figure with all 200
      antigens as visibility-toggled traces and a dropdown menu (Section 5).

### 4. Bead-count QC
- [x] **New table** built in `qc_beads.py::qc_bead_counts`. Returns
      `matrix` (analytes × wells, raw counts), `tier_matrix` (red /
      yellow / green strings), and a `problems` long-format DataFrame
      sorted red-first. Rendered in the report as a discrete-tier
      Plotly heatmap.
- [x] **Problem list** included as an HTML table below the heatmap and
      exported as `bead_problems_<plate>.csv` from the pipeline.
- [x] Threshold pair wired through Settings (`bead_count_min` /
      `bead_count_warn`) and into the Plotly heatmap legend.

### 5. Reporting & UI
- [x] `templates/report.html` and `src/report.py` rewritten from
      scratch for the 200-antigen layout. Removed all kit-control / NC
      bead / replicate-CV sections. Plotly is loaded via CDN once.
- [x] Bead-Count matrix + IN/OUT-of-Range matrix, both as Plotly
      heatmaps with discrete colour scales and per-cell hover.
- [x] Standard-Curve Picker — Plotly subplot (curve | rug) driven by
      an HTML5 `<input list>` typeahead. Title updates with `fit_ok`
      and the four 4PL parameters. The original `updatemenus`
      dropdown was removed in Session 8d (typeahead made it
      redundant). Single-column rug for the current plate plus a
      separate "Past" column; per-antigen status counts live in an
      upper-right summary box on the curve panel.
- [x] Per-antigen Standard-Curve Summary table (a, b, c=IC50, d, LLOQ
      / ULOQ dilutions, %-in-range, QC warnings, `fit_ok` badge).
      Excluded-analyte rows rendered muted.
- [x] Banner sections: excluded analytes (warn-yellow); Box xlsx
      identifier and patient-ID resolution count (info-blue).
- [x] Specimen-results table not embedded — 200 cols × 84 rows would
      blow up the page. Three CSV download buttons replace it
      (`specimens_*.csv`, `in_range_*.csv`, `pct_in_range_*.csv`).

### 6. Validation
- [x] End-to-end run on `Pilot_Uvira_XXL/`. Report renders with all
      200 antigens, the 3 excluded bead regions are visually muted
      across every section, bead-count and range matrices populate
      correctly. Smoke-tested repeatedly through Sessions 4–10 with
      `~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/QC_PLATE_05112026_RUN000.html`
      as the canonical output. Synthetic 2 / 3-plate scenarios also
      exercised (`QC_3plate_*.html` in the same folder).
- [x] Cross-check a handful of patient IDs against
      `RENAMED-Box1_Uvira_sera_2023.xlsx`. 14/14 spot-checks
      passed across box rows A–G, columns 1 + 12. Box row H
      (12 samples) was intentionally omitted from the plate, which
      explains the 96 → 84 specimen count exactly. Box-row → plate-
      row shift confirmed: box A → plate B, … box G → plate H
      (Standards occupy plate row A). Done Session 11.

### 8. Usability + cross-plate features (Session 6+)

User requests (2026-05-18) after reviewing the first end-to-end Uvira
report:

- [x] **Report navigation.** Sticky left sidebar with section links
      (TOC) plus per-section `<details>` collapse. Done Session 6.
- [x] **Bead-Count Matrix — summary cards** + downloadable
      `bead_problem_antigens_<plate>.csv` /
      `bead_problem_samples_<plate>.csv`. Threshold shared across
      bead + range summaries (Settings: `problem_fraction_threshold`,
      default 0.20). Done Session 6.
- [x] **Bead-Count Matrix — group separators.** Dotted vertical
      lines between Standards / Background / NC / specimen columns,
      derived from `well_type`. Done Session 6.
- [x] **Standard-Curve summary cards** + downloadable
      `range_problem_antigens_<plate>.csv` /
      `range_problem_samples_<plate>.csv`. Four cards: antigens
      below / above + samples below / above. Done Session 6.
- [x] **Curve Picker — rug plot.** Right-edge specimen MFI ticks
      colored by BELOW_RANGE / IN_RANGE / ABOVE_RANGE / NO_FIT, plus
      a grey rug for historical-plate specimens. New
      `specimen_mfi_history.json` persists per (plate, well, analyte).
      Done Session 8.
- [x] **Curve Picker — historical curves.** Grey dotted overlays of
      every previous plate's 4PL, sourced from
      `fit_history_<pool>.json`. Done Session 8.
- [x] **Range Matrix — CB-friendly recolor.** Palette: BELOW =
      #4477AA blue, IN = #44AA99 teal, ABOVE = #EE7733 orange,
      NO_FIT = #CCBB44 yellow (Paul Tol / Okabe-Ito). Grey reserved
      for the historical overlays now. Done Session 6.
- [x] **Background QC.** New `qc_background.py` module computing
      `n_wells`, `mean_mfi`, `sd_mfi`, `cv`, `max_mfi`, `cv_flag`,
      `max_flag` per antigen. Renders as the Background QC section
      with summary cards and a per-antigen table; exported as
      `background_qc_<plate>.csv`. Settings:
      `bg_cv_threshold` (default 0.25 = 25%), `bg_max_mfi`
      (default 100). Done Session 6.
- [x] **Curve Picker — typeahead + subplot.** HTML5 `<input list>`
      autocomplete drives `Plotly.update` per antigen. Plotly's old
      `updatemenus` dropdown removed. Figure split into a 2-column
      subplot: standards + 4PL on the left, single rug column for
      this plate (status-coloured stack) + separate Past column on
      the right. Per-antigen status counts in an upper-right summary
      box on the curve panel, swapped via `Plotly.relayout` on each
      pick. Done Sessions 8c–8d.
- [x] **Curve Picker — per-plate legend toggle.** Each past plate is
      its own legend entry (one curve trace + one rug trace, both
      hidden together via `legendgroup="plate:<plate_id>"`).
      Click = hide / show; double-click = isolate. Plate labels
      shortened in the legend to `MM/DD/YYYY · R<N> · Box<N>` (full
      label kept in hovers and the figure title). Done Session 8d.
- [x] **Negative Control QC history.** New
      `nc_well_history.json` persisted per
      `(plate_id, well, analyte)`. NC QC section renders a
      cross-plate Purples heatmap when ≥ 1 prior plate is in
      history. Done Session 7b.
- [x] **Plate Layout overview.** 8 × 12 Plotly heatmap inserted at
      the top of the Plate Overview section, cells colour-coded by
      `well_type` (Standards / Background / NC / specimen) and
      labelled with the sample name. Inline legend swatch above the
      heatmap. Done Session 10.
- [x] **Background MFI overview (all plates).** Cross-plate scatter
      in the Background QC section: x = antigen (panel order from
      the current plate's CSV header), y = mean Background MFI on a
      log scale, one trace per plate, current plate accented and
      suffixed `(current)` in the legend. Excluded analytes
      italicised in the tick labels. Powered by a new
      `background_history.json` (dedup key
      `[plate_id, analyte]`). Static figure (no scroll), 6 pt tick
      labels rotated -90°, horizontal legend along the top. Done
      Session 10 (third mid-session iteration).
- [x] **Specimen-MFI history → curve-picker rug.** New
      `specimen_mfi_history.json` (dedup key
      `[plate_id, well, analyte]`) feeds the Past column of the
      curve picker's rug subplot. Done Session 8.
- [x] **Plotly.js load-order fix.** `_plotly_html` embeds the
      Plotly.js bundle on its first call; reorderered the
      figure-build calls in `generate_report` to match the
      template's section order so the bundle lands at DOM line
      ~211, well ahead of any `newPlot` call. Done Session 10 (bug
      fix).
- [x] **Accept `Control` as an NC label.** `^Control` added to
      `NC_PATTERNS` default. Done Session 12.
- [x] **Input file's `Type` column is now the primary
      classification signal** (option 3 from Session 13's design
      review). `classify.py::classify_wells` reads
      `plate_well_type` (added to `data` by `build_layout` *before*
      the classify step) and maps `standard → pc`, `background →
      background`, `control → nc`, `unknown → specimen`; sample-name
      regex stays as the fallback for runs without an input file
      and for rows whose `plate_well_type` is missing / unrecognised.
      Pipeline reordered so the layout merge runs before classify.
      Lets operators name a Control well anything (e.g. `NI7`,
      `Pool_B`) without editing Settings. Done Session 13.

### 7. Packaging & docs
- [x] `README.md` rewritten end-to-end for the Uvira 200-plex /
      Intelliflex assay. Done Session 9.
- [x] `SPECIFICATION.md` rewritten end-to-end. Done Session 9.
- [x] PyInstaller specs renamed `mpox-luminex-qc{,-win}.spec` →
      `uvira-luminex-qc{,-win}.spec`. Product name, bundle id, and
      hiddenimports list refreshed (legacy `qc_kit_controls`,
      `qc_replicates` dropped; `qc_background` added; matplotlib
      added since the small-multiples curve grid needs it).
      Done Session 9.
- [x] GitHub URL in `templates/web/index.html` swapped to
      `GenevaIDD/uvira-luminex-qc`. Done Session 9.
- [x] Legacy `scripts/generate_test_data.py` (MagPix 12-plex MPXV
      synthetic data, no longer referenced) deleted. Done Session 9.
- [ ] **Actually build** the macOS `.app` (and Windows `.exe` on a
      Windows machine) with the renamed specs; sign the macOS bundle
      with `codesign --force --deep --sign -`. Defer until a real
      release is needed.

### 9. Potential future work (not yet scoped)

Captured during interpretation of the three pilot runs — design
decisions still TBD.

- [ ] **Respect `fit_ok` in the range matrix** (option A from the
      Session 14 review). When the 4PL fit fails QC (R² ≥ 0.95 on
      log10, IC50 in tested range, Hill slope 0.3–5.0, dynamic range
      ≥ 3×), force every specimen on that antigen to `NO_FIT`
      regardless of where its MFI falls. Motivation: on plate 2
      (`PLATE_05182026_RUN000`) ~5,400 specimen-antigen cells got an
      `IN_RANGE` verdict against bounds derived from a broken curve
      (LLOQ-MFI ≈ noise floor, ULOQ-MFI ≈ S1). The "in range" verdict
      is mathematically correct but clinically meaningless because
      the bounds themselves are bogus. Strict gating on `fit_ok`
      removes the false-positive IN_RANGE count without any new
      tuning parameters; the Standard-Curve Summary already
      advertises FAIL on those antigens. See
      [`PLATE_RUN_FINDINGS.md`](PLATE_RUN_FINDINGS.md) for the data.
      Alternative considered: a dynamic-range / Background-floor
      sanity check on the bounds themselves; rejected as
      over-engineered for the same outcome.
- [ ] **Specimens-on-curve scatter in the picker** (option B from
      Session 14). Move the right-edge rug points into the curve
      subplot as scatter markers at
      `(invert_4pl(specimen_mfi), specimen_mfi)` — so each specimen
      lands *on the 4PL line* at its interpolated dilution, coloured
      by `status` (BELOW / IN / ABOVE / NO_FIT). User would see at a
      glance which specimens cluster on the upper plateau vs the
      inflection vs the lower asymptote. Trade-off: with 82+
      specimens overlaid on a single curve, the inflection area can
      get crowded — would need light transparency + small markers.
      The separate rug panel could be removed or kept as a count
      summary. Decision deferred until the standards problem is
      resolved on a future plate (otherwise the back-calculated
      x-positions would be against a broken curve).

| 8 | One **shared `problem_fraction_threshold`** (default 0.20) drives all the "≥X% problematic" summary counts. | 2026-05-18 |

| 11 | Curve picker is a **two-panel subplot** (curve \| rug), not an overlaid rug.

| 15 | Background MFI overview uses **panel order** on the x-axis (not signal-magnitude sort) and is a **static, responsive figure** (no horizontal scroll). 6 pt rotated tick labels, horizontal legend along the top. | 2026-05-18 |
| 16 | The Intelliflex input file's `Type` column is the **primary signal** for well classification (Standard / Background / Control / Unknown → pc / background / nc / specimen). Sample-name regex stays as the fallback for wells without `plate_well_type` and for runs where no input file is uploaded. Lets operators name a Control well anything (e.g. `NI7`, `Pool_B`) without editing Settings. | 2026-05-18 |

## Open questions for the user

- **Should multi-run xPONENT CSVs be a first-class feature?** As of
  Session 20, the app itself still only ingests single-plate CSVs —
  multi-run files (e.g. `D4repeat_D-F_UviraBox1_03-06-2026.csv`,
  which packed 5 reads into one file) are handled by a manual
  preprocessing step (`scripts/split_multiplate_csv.py`) that the
  operator runs from the terminal before uploading. If multi-run
  exports are going to be the norm on the Intelliflex going forward,
  this should be lifted into the Flask upload flow (auto-detect the
  `N(plate_idx,well)` Location pattern, prompt for plate labels +
  re-run assignments, run the pipeline once per logical plate). If
  they're an occasional one-off, the script is fine as-is. **Need to
  decide.**

---

## Session History

### Session 20 — 2026-06-04 (Multi-run xPONENT CSV splitter — Plates 5 & 6)

User uploaded a single xPONENT CSV
(`D4repeat_D-F_UviraBox1_03-06-2026.csv`) containing **five plate
reads** packed into one file: two partial-plate full reads (Plate
D-F and Plate A-C, Box1 samples split across them) plus three
single-well dry-read re-runs (D4, A1, H9). The Intelliflex encodes
the plate origin in the `Location` field as `N(plate_idx,well)`.

**Approach decided with the user** (`AskUserQuestion`):

- Plate IDs: `PLATE_06032026_PlateDF` + `PLATE_06032026_PlateAC`.
- Re-run merge: **replace the dry-read value** with the re-run value
  in the parent plate (cleanest for downstream QC).
- PBS wells (E/F/G + H7, labelled `UnknownNN`): **classify as
  Background** so they feed the noisy-antigen detection logic. 39
  background wells per plate (vs 2 on previous plates) → much
  tighter SNR estimate.
- Giardia NC wells (H8–H10, labelled `Giardia*`): **classify as
  Control**, joining NI7/NI18 in the NC heatmap and
  `nc_well_history.json`.

**Implementation:**

Wrote `scripts/split_multiplate_csv.py` — a standalone preprocessor
that:

- Reads the multi-plate xPONENT CSV in one pass.
- Detects the re-run plate indices (3, 4, 5) and the wells they
  re-read; assigns each re-run row to whichever parent plate (1 or
  2) is missing that well in its own block (warns if ambiguous or
  not missing in either).
- Emits **one xPONENT-format CSV per logical plate** with: (i) the
  original metadata header (Batch field rewritten to the logical
  plate ID), (ii) each `DataType:` block from the source, restricted
  to the rows for that parent + the assigned re-run rows. Location
  fields are renormalised to `N(1,well)` so the existing parser
  doesn't need plate-aware logic.
- Also emits a per-plate `<label>_inputfile.csv` with
  Location/Type/Description so the pipeline's authoritative
  Type-column classification picks up the new layout (Standards /
  Background / Unknown / Control mapping per the user's plate
  spec). Serum-well Description = barcode so the Box1 xlsx lookup
  still resolves patient IDs.

No changes needed to the pipeline, parser, classify, or report code
— the splitter writes files that look exactly like a single-plate
xPONENT export, so everything downstream just runs.

**Smoke results** (both reports in
`~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/`):

| | PlateDF | PlateAC |
|---|---|---|
| Wells parsed | 90 (89 + 1 D4 re-run) | 87 (85 + A1 + H9 re-runs) |
| Specimens | 36 | 36 |
| Patient-ID resolution | 36/36 ✓ | 36/36 ✓ |
| NC samples | GiardiaG422, GiardiaKin67, GiardiaU21, NI7, NI18 | same |
| Background wells | 39 | 39 |
| Standards S1/S2 (mAbs) | **2.0–2.6×** ✓ | **1.9–2.4×** ✓ |
| In-range cells | 4,589 | 4,402 |
| `fit_ok` | most analytes pass | most analytes pass |

**The standards problem from plates 2/3/4 is resolved.** Both new
plates show clean dilution series with S1/S2 ratios on par with the
pilot. Specimen-level interpretation can be trusted again. Full
write-up in [`PLATE_RUN_FINDINGS.md`](PLATE_RUN_FINDINGS.md) under
Plates 5 & 6.

**One thing worth flagging from the data**: `GiardiaKin67` reads
~50× higher than the other two Giardia NC wells on `HHV_CMV` across
both plates (7,211 / 8,127 MFI vs 145–236 for GiardiaU21 / G422).
Replicates across the two plates rule out a per-plate handling
error — the sample itself looks like it's either CMV-positive or
contaminated. Worth raising with the lab.

**Files touched:**

- `scripts/split_multiplate_csv.py` (new, ~190 lines).
- `PLATE_RUN_FINDINGS.md` — index row + per-plate section + Session
  20 stamp.
- `UVIRA_TODO.md` — this entry.

**Carry-over to Session 21+:** unchanged from prior. If multi-run
xPONENT files become a routine input format, lifting the splitter
into the Flask upload flow (auto-detect multi-plate CSVs, prompt
for plate labels, run twice) is a reasonable next step. For now the
script is run manually.

### Session 19 — 2026-05-28 (Cross-run scatter legend toggle fix)

Same `showlegend=(ai == 0)` bug that bit the curve picker in
Session 16 also affected the cross-run scatter introduced in
Session 18. Symptom was identical: clicking a past-plate legend
entry only worked when the first antigen was selected; after
typeaheading to a different antigen the legend either disappeared
or did nothing.

**Fix** (mirrors Session 16):

- `src/report.py::_make_cross_run_scatter`:
  - Per-antigen scatter traces now have `showlegend=False, name=""`.
  - One **anchor trace per past plate** appended after the per-antigen
    build loop. Each anchor carries `x=[None], y=[None],
    hoverinfo="skip", showlegend=True, visible=True, legendgroup=
    "plate:<plate_id>"`. The marker style matches its data trace
    series so the legend entry's icon is visually consistent.
  - New `trace_plate_map` array (`null` for the y=x reference line,
    `plate_id` for every per-antigen and anchor trace).
  - Per-antigen `vis` arrays in the typeahead lookup now have length
    `n_total = 1 + len(analytes) × P + P` and toggle anchor positions
    to `true` by default; the JS shim downgrades them to
    `"legendonly"` for any plate the user has hidden.
  - JS shim rewritten — same shape as the curve picker's:
    `hiddenPlates` object, `applyVisibility(entry)`,
    `plotly_legendclick` / `plotly_legenddoubleclick` interceptors
    (returns `false` to prevent Plotly's default toggle), and a
    typeahead `pick(name)` that sets `currentEntry` then calls
    `applyVisibility` + `Plotly.relayout` for the title.
  - Stale `n_traces = ... + 1` removed; counts are now computed after
    the build loop based on the actual number of anchors appended.

**Smoke tests on all four plates:**

| Plate | Past plates | Cross-run trace count | Anchors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pilot (no past plates) | 0 | section hidden — no past data | — |
| 18-05 | 1 | 199 = 1 ref + 197×1 + 1 anchor ✓ | 1 ✓ |
| 27-05 RUN000 | 2 | 397 = 1 ref + 197×2 + 2 anchors ✓ | 2 ✓ |
| 27-05 RUN002 | 3 | 595 = 1 ref + 197×3 + 3 anchors ✓ | 3 ✓ |

User-visible behaviour:
- The cross-run scatter legend now lists the same past plates on
  every antigen.
- Click a past-plate entry → that series hides on the current
  antigen AND stays hidden when the user typeaheads to a different
  antigen.
- Double-click → isolate that plate (hide all others); double-click
  again to restore.
- The y=x reference line uses Plotly's default legend behaviour
  (its trace_plate_map entry is `null` so the interceptor falls
  through).

### Session 18 — 2026-05-28 (Cross-run MFI comparison + per-plate rug columns + enriched hover)

Three additions in response to user feedback after reviewing the
plate-4 report.

**1. Per-plate rug columns.** The rug subplot used to have two
x-positions: "This run" at `x=0` and "Past" (all past plates
stacked) at `x=1`. Now it has **1 + P columns**: `x=0` for the
current run plus one column per past plate at `x=1..P`. Each column
gets a short date-only header above it (e.g. `05/11/2026`); the
existing colour-coded `This run` header stays. Vertical separator
between current and first past plate is heavier than the separators
between past plates so the visual "this vs past" boundary is clear.

The rug subplot's width now scales with the number of plate columns:
`rug_width = min(0.08 × (1 + P) + 0.04, 0.42)` and the curve panel
takes the remainder. With 3 past plates the rug is ~32 % of figure
width; the curve panel keeps the rest. Cap at 0.42 prevents the
curve from collapsing on long-running histories.

**2. Enriched rug hovers.** Both current-plate and past-plate rug
ticks now show `Sample: {barcode} (well {well})`, `Patient ID:
{patient_id}`, and `MFI {y}`. Past-plate ticks additionally lead
with `<b>{plate label · Box{N}}</b>`. Required adding `patient_id`
and `barcode` to `specimen_mfi_history.json` (`_build_specimen_mfi_history`
in `pipeline.py` updated to include them in `keep`).

**3. Cross-run MFI comparison scatter** (new). For the selected
antigen, every sample that exists on both this plate and a past
plate produces a point at `(current_mfi, past_mfi)`. One trace per
past plate (legend-toggleable); a faint dotted `y = x` reference
line behind the scatter shows where perfect agreement would land.
- Log axes on both sides.
- Sample identity preference for the join: `patient_id` > `barcode`
  > `sample_name`. Specimens with no patient_id still match via
  barcode.
- Hover shows the past-plate label, the sample barcode, patient ID,
  well on each plate, and both MFI values.
- Antigen swap driven by a separate `<input list>` typeahead
  (`#cross-run-input`) wired with its own `Plotly.restyle` + 3-arg
  `relayout` for the title. Initial display is the first analyte;
  the typeahead toggles trace visibility per antigen.
- Renders only when there's at least one past plate AND at least one
  joinable sample; the template gates the section on
  `cross_run_present`.

**Files edited:**

- `src/pipeline.py::_build_specimen_mfi_history` — added `barcode`
  and `patient_id` to the `keep` list. History file grows by two
  columns per row.
- `src/report.py::_make_curve_picker`:
  - `RUG_X` reduced to status-only (no more fixed `HIST` slot).
  - Past-plate rug loop indexes `enumerate(past_plates)` and uses
    `x_pos = 1 + plate_idx` for the per-plate column.
  - Both rug hovertemplates rewritten to include sample + patient
    ID + well + MFI.
  - `_rug_annotations` rebuilt to emit one header per column.
  - Subplot scaffold's `column_widths` now scales with `P`; summary
    annotation anchor uses `curve_width - 0.01` so it tracks.
  - `rug_x_range = [-0.5, 0.5 + P]`.
  - Column separator loop draws between each adjacent pair (heavier
    between This/Past, lighter between past pairs).
- `src/report.py::_make_cross_run_scatter` (**new**) — full
  implementation per #3 above. ~180 lines. Returns empty string
  when there's no past data or no joinable samples.
- `src/report.py::generate_report` — calls `_make_cross_run_scatter`,
  passes `cross_run_html` and `cross_run_present` to the template.
- `templates/report.html` — new `<h3>Cross-run MFI comparison</h3>`
  subsection inside the Standard-Curve Picker `<details>`, gated on
  `cross_run_present`.

**Smoke tests:**

- Pilot (Plate 1, no past plates): cross-run section correctly
  hidden. Per-plate rug columns reduced to just `This run` (P=0).
  No regression.
- 18-05 (Plate 2, 1 past plate): cross-run scatter shows pilot vs
  this-plate for every joinable sample.
- 27-05 RUN000 (Plate 3, 2 past plates): rug subplot has 3 columns
  (This + pilot + 18-05). Cross-run scatter shows 2 series (pilot,
  18-05).
- 27-05 RUN002 (Plate 4, 3 past plates): rug subplot has 4
  columns; cross-run scatter has 3 past-plate series.
  - `specimen_mfi_history.json` ends at 65,262 rows with columns
    `[analyte, barcode, box_id, mfi, patient_id, plate_id, run_date,
    sample_name, status, well]`. patient_id correctly persisted.
  - Verified the cross-run hover template, the per-plate rug
    headers, and the patient_id field in both rug hover variants
    via raw HTML grep.

**Carry-over to Session 19+:** unchanged.

### Session 17 — 2026-05-28 (Rug subplot y-axis alignment fix)

User reported a subtle alignment issue: when hovering on the
standard-curve line in the picker, the value shown in the tooltip
didn't visually align with the y-axis position the cursor was on.
Specimens in the rug column also looked off relative to the same
MFI value on the curve.

**Root cause:** the curve subplot (col 1) had `type='log'` set
explicitly on its y-axis. The rug subplot (col 2) had `matches='y'`
(set automatically by `shared_yaxes=True` in `make_subplots`) but
was missing an explicit `type='log'`. Plotly's `matches` constraint
propagates the *range* between two axes but **does not reliably
propagate the scale type** — so the rug's y-axis was effectively
linear with a range derived from the log-axis's range, which
re-projects every MFI value to a different visual position than on
the curve panel.

Result: a specimen at MFI = 290 sat at a different vertical pixel
in the rug than where the curve crossed MFI = 290. Confirmed by
parsing the layout JSON out of one of the generated reports —
`yaxis` had `type='log'`, but `yaxis2` had no `type` set
(falling back to linear).

**Fix:** one extra line in `_make_curve_picker`:

```python
fig.update_yaxes(type="log", showgrid=True, row=1, col=2)  # was: no type
```

A comment was added next to the `update_yaxes` calls explaining the
gotcha so this doesn't get reintroduced.

**Verification (after regenerate):**

- `yaxis`:  `type='log', matches=None`
- `yaxis2`: `type='log', matches='y'`

Both subplots now share a log y-axis. Every MFI value renders at
the same pixel-y in both panels.

All 4 plates re-processed in
`~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/`.

### Session 16 — 2026-05-28 (Curve-picker legend toggle persists across antigens)

User reported a bug: in the Standard-Curve Picker, the per-plate
legend toggles only worked for the first antigen on the list. After
typeaheading to a different antigen, clicking a legend entry did
nothing.

**Root cause:** the per-antigen past-plate traces had
`showlegend=True` only when `ai == 0` (i.e. the first antigen). When
the typeahead switched to a different antigen, Plotly set the first
antigen's traces (the ones hosting the legend) to `visible=False`,
which made the legend entries either vanish or refer to invisible
traces — clicking them had no visible effect.

**Fix:** anchor every legend entry on a dedicated **always-visible**
trace that lives outside the per-antigen slot scheme. Add a JS state
machine that tracks user toggles in a `hiddenPlates` set and merges
that state with the typeahead's per-antigen visibility on every
restyle, so the user's choice survives antigen switches.

**Files edited:**

- `src/report.py::_make_curve_picker`:
  - **Anchor traces (new).** After the per-antigen loop, append:
    - One `legendgroup="current"` Standards anchor (marker style).
    - One `legendgroup="current"` "This plate (`{plate_id} · Box{N}`)"
      anchor (blue line style).
    - One `legendgroup="plate:<plate_id>"` anchor per past plate
      (grey dotted line style).
    All anchors carry `x=[None], y=[None], hoverinfo="skip"` and
    `showlegend=True, visible=True`.
  - **Per-antigen traces.** All Standards / 4PL / past-curve /
    past-rug traces now have `showlegend=False` and `name=""` (they
    no longer try to host their own legend entries).
  - **`trace_plate_map`** — array of length `n_total_traces`. Entry
    is `plate_id` for any trace whose visibility should be
    controlled by per-plate legend toggle; `null` for current-plate
    traces. Includes the tail anchor traces.
  - **`n_total_traces = n_traces + 2 + P`** (2 current-plate anchors +
    P past-plate anchors).
  - **Per-antigen `vis` arrays in `lookup`** now have length
    `n_total_traces`; the anchor positions are all `True` by default
    and get downgraded to `"legendonly"` by the JS shim when the
    user hides a plate.
- `src/report.py` JS shim — rewritten:
  - State: `hiddenPlates = {}` (object as Set, plate_id → true).
  - `applyVisibility(entry)` — clones `entry.vis`, for every trace
    that maps to a hidden plate downgrades to `"legendonly"`, then
    calls `Plotly.restyle`.
  - `plotly_legendclick` handler — for past-plate clicks
    (`tracePlateMap[curveNumber]` non-null), toggles the plate in
    `hiddenPlates` and reapplies visibility; returns `false` to
    prevent Plotly's default toggle. Current-plate ("current"
    legendgroup) clicks fall through to Plotly's default behaviour.
  - `plotly_legenddoubleclick` handler — implements isolate
    semantics (double-click a past plate → hide all others; if
    already isolated, restore all).
  - `pick(name)` — sets `currentEntry`, calls `applyVisibility`,
    then `Plotly.relayout` for the title and annotations (latter
    drives the per-antigen status-count box).
  - Wires the legend handlers on `plotly_legendclick` /
    `plotly_legenddoubleclick`, defaulting to `window.load` when
    the chart hasn't been drawn yet.

**Tests:**

- All 4 plates re-processed cleanly.
- Trace-count sanity: pilot (no past plates) = 1202 (200 × 6 + 2);
  RUN002 (3 past plates) = 2369 (197 × 12 + 2 + 3).
- `tracePlateMap` correctly tags 1185 past-plate slots (197 × 6 +
  3 anchors) on the RUN002 report.
- All 5 anchor traces present in RUN002 figure JSON:
  Standards anchor, This-plate-4PL anchor, and one per past plate
  (`PLATE_05112026_RUN000`, `PLATE_05182026_RUN000`,
  `PLATE_05272026_RUN000`).
- JS shim contains `hiddenPlates`, `applyVisibility`,
  `plotly_legendclick`, `plotly_legenddoubleclick` and the typeahead
  `pick`.

**User-visible behaviour change:**

- Legend entries are now always present regardless of which antigen
  is selected.
- Click a past-plate entry → that plate's overlays hide on the
  current antigen AND stay hidden when the user switches to a
  different antigen.
- Double-click a past-plate entry → isolate to just that plate;
  double-click again to restore all.
- Current-plate legend entries ("Standards", "This plate (…)") use
  Plotly's default toggle behaviour (single-click hides every
  per-antigen Standards / 4PL / status-rug trace; not particularly
  useful but kept for completeness).

### Session 15 — 2026-05-28 (PMT operating mode in metadata + 4th plate)

User uploaded a fourth Box1 run (`PLATE_05272026_RUN002`, high-PMT
re-read of the same physical plate as `PLATE_05272026_RUN000`). The
user flagged that yesterday's run was on **Low PMT** and asked for
the operating mode to be surfaced in the Plate Overview so this
class of issue is spottable at a glance.

**Key finding — explains the plate 3 anomaly.** The 27-05 first try
(`PLATE_05272026_RUN000`) was run on `Luminex® 200™ Low PMT`; the
pilot, the 18-05 re-run, and this new high-PMT 27-05 re-read are all
on `FLEXMAP 3D® High PMT`. Low PMT produces MFI roughly an order of
magnitude lower than High PMT, which is why the 27-05 first try's
Background MFI looked dramatically lower than every other plate
(documented in Session 14's review). After the high-PMT re-read,
the Background levels for that physical plate fall back in line
with the pilot.

**Files edited:**
- `src/parse_xponent.py` — `field_map` entry for
  `ProtocolOperatingMode → operating_mode`, with a comment
  explaining the cross-plate MFI gotcha.
- `templates/report.html` — new "Operating mode:" cell in the
  Plate Overview metadata grid. Colour-coded: green for High PMT,
  amber for Low PMT, plus a `⚠ Low PMT` badge (with hover tooltip)
  whenever the string contains `Low PMT`. The hint text reads
  "Low PMT mode produces ~10× lower MFI than High PMT — confirm
  this was intentional before comparing to other plates".

**Pipeline runs:** all four plates re-processed into
`~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/` so every report carries the new
field. Smoke output now contains:

| Plate | Operating mode | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `PLATE_05112026_RUN000` (pilot) | FLEXMAP 3D® High PMT | -- |
| `PLATE_05182026_RUN000` (re-run 1) | FLEXMAP 3D® High PMT | -- |
| `PLATE_05272026_RUN000` (re-run 2, first try) | **Luminex® 200™ Low PMT** ⚠ | -- |
| `PLATE_05272026_RUN002` (re-run 2, high-PMT re-read) | FLEXMAP 3D® High PMT | new this session |

**Standard-curve diagnostic on the new plate** (high-PMT re-read of
the 27-05 sample):
- The S1/S2 ratios are still **30–50×** (should be ~4×). PMT was
  not the issue — this is the same wet-lab dilution failure we
  flagged on the original 27-05 plate. S3 again reads higher than
  S2 on multiple antigens, repeating the A2 < A3 pathology.
- Confirms (definitively) that the standards problem is upstream
  of detection — re-reading the same physical plate at higher PMT
  doesn't recover the missing carryover.

**Bead-count side-effect:** the high-PMT re-read shows 19 red + 1028
yellow bead-count cells (vs 0 + 4 on the low-PMT first read of the
same physical plate). Bead recovery degraded on the second read.
Documented in [`PLATE_RUN_FINDINGS.md`](PLATE_RUN_FINDINGS.md).

**Cross-plate state after this session:**
- `nc_well_history.json` now spans 3 plates (18-05, 27-05 RUN000,
  27-05 RUN002).
- `background_history.json` / `fit_history_PC.json` /
  `specimen_mfi_history.json` span all 4 plates.

**Carry-over to Session 16+:** unchanged.

### Session 14 — 2026-05-27 (Third plate processed — 27-05 Box1 rerun)

User uploaded a **third** Box1 plate run (`PLATE_05272026_RUN000`)
with the same layout as the 18-05 rerun (Standards A1–A10,
Background A11–A12, 82 specimens, Controls NI7 / NI18 in H11 / H12).
The goal was both (a) to verify the option-3 classification still
works on a fresh plate and (b) to assess whether the standard-curve
problem we flagged on the 18-05 plate had been resolved.

**Pipeline run:**

- Processed into the existing `~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/`
  output directory, so the new plate accumulates alongside the
  pilot + 18-05 rerun in every history JSON.
- No code changes needed — the option-3 (`plate_well_type`) signal
  classified H11 / H12 as `nc` correctly. NI7 / NI18 land in the
  NC QC section with their MFI carried into `nc_well_history.json`.
- 82 specimens (= 84 wells − 2 NCs), 197 antigens, run-date
  `2026-05-27 16:08`.

**Cross-plate history now spans three plates** (verified by
inspecting the JSONs in `smoke/history/`):

| History file | Rows | Plates |
|---|---|---|
| `fit_history_PC.json` | 594 | pilot + 18-05 + 27-05 |
| `specimen_mfi_history.json` | 49,108 | all three |
| `background_history.json` | 594 | all three |
| `std_curve_history_PC.json` | 5,940 | all three |
| `nc_well_history.json` | 788 | 18-05 + 27-05 (pilot had no NCs) |

The 27-05 report (`QC_PLATE_05272026_RUN000.html`) now overlays
the pilot AND the 18-05 plate as past-plate traces in the curve
picker, NC heatmap, and Background MFI overview. Each is its own
legend entry (`05/11/2026 · R0 · Box1`, `05/18/2026 · R0 · Box1`,
`05/27/2026 · R0 · Box1`), toggleable independently.

**Standard-curve quality assessment (lab observation, not an app
issue):**

Sampled the standards block for mAbs + a few strong-signal
antigens. The 27-05 plate is **noticeably better than the 18-05
plate** but **still off** from the expected 4-fold serial dilution:

| Antigen | S1 MFI | S2 MFI | **S1/S2 ratio** | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BAC_S.typhi_HlyE *(mAb)* | 4,973 | 130 | **38.3×** | ~4× |
| CHO_CtxB *(mAb)* | 1,725 | 46 | **37.8×** | ~4× |
| CHO_Inaba_OSP *(mAb)* | 8,059 | 188 | **42.8×** | ~4× |
| CHO_Ogawa_OSP *(mAb)* | 9,373 | 207 | **45.3×** | ~4× |
| ARB_YFV_E | 698 | 19 | **36.9×** | ~4× |
| RES_Ade5_hexon | 1,365 | 52 | **26.2×** | ~4× |
| HHV_CMV | 3,400 | 71 | **48.1×** | ~4× |

The 18-05 plate had S1/S2 ratios of 60-760× (basically S2-S10 sat
at the noise floor). The 27-05 plate has S1/S2 ≈ 30-50× — so this
time *some* dilution propagated, but the step was much too big.
Most likely the second dilution wasn't quite 1:4 — closer to
1:30 by the ratios, consistent with a missed second carryover
step or a partial / wrong-volume transfer between A1 and A2.

Subsequent dilutions (A3 onwards) drop into noise: HylE goes
4,973 → 130 → 376 → 13 → 7 → … — A3 actually being *higher* than
A2 is a strong clue that the wells received different volumes /
sources, not a clean serial dilution down the row.

App is doing the right thing — most `fit_ok` flags will read
FAIL for this plate because the dynamic-range and R² QC criteria
can't be satisfied by a 1-or-2-point curve sitting above a flat
tail. AU values and Range Matrix entries for this plate should
not be trusted; bead counts, Background QC, NC heatmap, and the
historical overlays remain useful.

**Carry-over to Session 15+:** unchanged from prior sessions —
actual macOS / Windows release builds when needed.

### Session 13 — 2026-05-18 (Input-file `Type` is the primary classification signal)

User uploaded a new plate run (18-05-2026 re-run of Box1) with two
**Control** wells in H11 / H12 — but their `Description` column in the
input file was `NI7` / `NI18`, **not** `Control`. Intelliflex carries
`Description` into the output CSV's `Sample` field, so the wells
arrived in the pipeline named `NI7` / `NI18` and the sample-name regex
classified them as `specimen` instead of `nc` (despite the input
file's `Type=Control`). The fix is structural: the input file's `Type`
column should override sample-name regex when both are present.

**Files edited:**

- `src/pipeline.py` —
  - The layout merge now runs **before** `classify_wells`, so
    `plate_well_type` (added by `build_layout`) is available as a
    column on `data` at classification time.
  - `keep_cols` extended to bring `plate_well_type` through the merge
    alongside `sample_id` / `barcode` / `patient_id` / `box_id`.
  - The legacy layout-xlsx branch still works: any `dilution` column
    on the legacy layout is renamed to `dilution_layout` before the
    merge so it survives, and a step after `classify_wells` overrides
    `dilution` from `dilution_layout` per-well.
- `src/classify.py` —
  - Module docstring rewritten to document the new priority:
    input-file `Type` is authoritative; sample-name regex is the
    fallback.
  - New constant `_PWT_TO_WELL_TYPE = {standard:pc, background:background,
    control:nc, unknown:specimen}`.
  - `classify_wells` runs the regex classification first (still the
    source of truth when no input file is uploaded), then — if
    `plate_well_type` is present on `df` — overrides the regex result
    for every row whose `plate_well_type` (lower-cased) maps to a
    known well type. Wells with an unrecognised `plate_well_type`
    (or with the column missing entirely) keep their regex result.

**Tests:**

- Unit-level on a 5-well fixture:
  1. With `plate_well_type` column → H11/H12 `Control` correctly
     classifies as `nc` even though sample names are `NI7` / `NI18`.
  2. Without `plate_well_type` → `NI7` / `NI18` fall through to
     `specimen` (regex fallback works).
  3. Mixed: one well with `plate_well_type="weird"` → that row falls
     back to its regex result; other rows use the override.
- End-to-end:
  - **New 18-05-2026 plate**: 82 specimens (was 84 before fix);
    `nc_levels_PLATE_05182026_RUN000.csv` written with 394 rows
    (= 2 wells × 197 antigens). NC sample names: `['NI18', 'NI7']`,
    in wells `['H11', 'H12']`.
  - **Pilot (Pilot_Uvira_XXL)**: 84 specimens (unchanged); no
    `nc_levels_*.csv` (correct — no NC wells on this plate). No
    regression.

**Post-implementation Q&A** (user verified both questions):

1. *Does the app work with both CSVs (no-NC pilot + with-NC rerun)?*
   Yes. The pipeline keys off the input file's `Type` column with no
   per-plate code path. Pilot's report renders the
   "No named negative-control wells on this plate" banner in the NC
   QC section; the new-plate report renders a populated NC heatmap
   for `NI7` / `NI18`. No regression on either output.

2. *Does `QC_PLATE_05182026_RUN000.html` show pilot data too?*
   Yes — because both plates were processed into the same output
   directory (`~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/`), and that
   directory's `history/` JSONs accumulated both plates. The shared
   history files end at:

   | History file | Rows | Plates |
   |---|---|---|
   | `fit_history_PC.json` | 397 | pilot + new |
   | `specimen_mfi_history.json` | 32,954 | pilot + new |
   | `background_history.json` | 397 | pilot + new |
   | `std_curve_history_PC.json` | 3,970 | pilot + new |
   | `nc_well_history.json` | 394 | new only (pilot had no NCs) |

   The new-plate report references the pilot plate_id **17,340×**
   (sample names, legendgroup tags, hover customdata, etc.) versus
   2× for itself as `(current)`. So the pilot is genuinely embedded
   as historical overlays — grey-dotted curve in the picker, "Past"
   column in the rug, second trace on the Background MFI overview.

   To start a fresh report with no historical overlay, process a
   plate into a new output directory (or delete the
   `history/` subdirectory before re-running).

**Carry-over to Session 14+:** unchanged — actual macOS / Windows
release builds when needed. Every other To-Do item is `[x]`.

### Session 12 — 2026-05-18 (Accept `Control` as an NC label)

User context: the new plate (re-run of the Box1 unknowns) has two
**Control** wells in H11 / H12 instead of leaving those positions
as Background. With the previous patterns those wells would have
fallen through to `specimen`. Smallest possible fix: extend the
default NC pattern list to accept `Control*`.

**Files edited:**

- `src/config.py` — `NC_PATTERNS` extended from `["^NC",
  "^Negative"]` to `["^NC", "^Negative", "^Control"]`. Comment
  refreshed to list the three accepted labels.
- `src/classify.py` — docstring updated.
- `src/qc_nc.py` — module docstring updated.
- `templates/report.html` — Negative Control QC explainer now
  reads "NC wells are identified by sample name matching `NC*`,
  `Negative*`, or `Control*` (editable on the Settings page)".
  The empty-state hint adds `Control` to the example label list.
- `README.md` and `SPECIFICATION.md` — both mention all three
  default patterns where they describe NC detection.

**No data-layer code changes** — the regex list flows through
`well_classification.nc_patterns` in the config and is read by
`classify._classify_sample`. Settings-page edits already let users
add their own patterns; this just bakes the common `Control` case
into the default so the user doesn't have to.

**Smoke tests:**

- Unit-level: `classify_wells` on `{Standard1, Background, Control,
  Control1, NC1, Negative_pool, FD22124871}` → `pc / background /
  nc / nc / nc / nc / specimen` ✓.
- Pilot end-to-end (`Pilot_Uvira_XXL/`): no `Control` wells on the
  pilot, but the regenerated report shows the updated explainer
  copy and the pipeline runs without regression.

**Carry-over to Session 13+:** unchanged — actual macOS / Windows
release builds when needed.

### Session 11 — 2026-05-18 (Section 6 patient-ID spot-check)

Closed the last open item in Section 6 — validating that the
barcode → patient_id join in `parse_layout.build_layout` actually
produces the right mapping on the pilot data.

**Procedure:**
1. Opened `RENAMED-Box1_Uvira_sera_2023.xlsx` directly (openpyxl).
   97 rows including header; columns `Container Id`,
   `Orientation Barcode`, `Row`, `Column`, `Barcode`,
   `Scan Time`, `Filename`, `Automatic Export Directory`, `ID`.
2. Picked 8 spread-out spot-checks (first / last column of box
   rows A, C, E, H). Cross-checked against
   `in_range_PLATE_05112026_RUN000.csv` from the smoke output.
   6/8 matched perfectly; the 2 box-row-H entries weren't found.
3. Reconciled with the Intelliflex `*_inputfile.csv`: 96 rows
   defined the plate (Standards + Background + 84 specimens). The
   84 specimens corresponded exactly to box rows A–G; box row H
   (12 samples) was intentionally omitted. So the 2 "misses" were
   correct — those barcodes were never on this plate.
4. Re-ran with 14 spot-checks across box rows A–G, columns 1 + 12.
   **14/14 passed** with the expected box-row → plate-row shift:
   box A → plate B, box B → plate C, …, box G → plate H (because
   plate row A holds Standards in A1–A10 and Background in A11–A12).

**Files touched:** none — this was a verification pass, not a code
change. The pipeline's existing `build_layout` join behaves
correctly.

**Carry-over to Session 12+:** only the actual macOS `.app` and
Windows `.exe` builds with the renamed PyInstaller specs (still
deferred until a release is needed). All other To-Do items
(Sections 0–8) are now `[x]`.

### Session 10 — 2026-05-18 (picker tightening + plate-layout + cross-plate Background overview)

Four user-driven refinements after seeing the Section-7 / Session-8d
report in the browser.

**Files edited:**

- `src/report.py::_make_curve_picker` — subplot tightened further:
  `column_widths` 0.82/0.18 → **0.88/0.12**, `horizontal_spacing`
  0.04 → **0.015**. Rug x-range tightened to `[-0.4, 1.4]` (with past
  plates) or `[-0.5, 0.5]` (without). Status-summary annotation
  anchor moved from `x=0.77` → `x=0.85` (paper) so it still pins to
  the upper-right of the curve subplot after the column-width
  change. Result: rug panel no longer has whitespace flanking its
  two columns, and the gap between the curve and the rug is barely
  perceptible.
- `src/report.py::_make_plate_layout_overview` (**new**) — 8×12
  Plotly heatmap of the plate, cells colour-coded by `well_type`
  (PC = #3498db, Background = #95a5a6, NC = #e67e22, specimen =
  #dff0e2). Sample name rendered in each cell (truncated to 12
  chars), full sample + type on hover. Wired into `generate_report`
  and surfaced in the Plate Overview section under a small
  legend.  Replaces the legacy MPOX plate heatmap (the legacy
  report had a per-well median-bead-count heatmap; this version
  shows the *layout* itself, which is more useful for spotting
  plate-setup errors).
- `src/report.py::_make_background_overview_plot` (**new**) —
  cross-plate scatter:
    - x = antigen, sorted by **max mean Background MFI across
      plates, descending**, so the consistently noisy antigens
      cluster on the left;
    - y = mean Background MFI, **log scale**;
    - one trace per plate, CB-friendly Paul-Tol palette;
    - current plate's markers slightly larger and fully opaque;
      past plates rendered at 55 % opacity;
    - excluded analytes pinned to the far right of the x-axis and
      italicised so they don't dominate the leading edge.
  Inserted into the Background QC section between the
  "How Background QC works" banner and the per-antigen table.
- `src/pipeline.py` — new `_build_background_history(metadata,
  bg_levels)` helper. `run_pipeline` reads / appends / saves
  `<history_dir>/background_history.json` (dedup key
  `[plate_id, analyte]`) and passes `history_background` through to
  `generate_report`. Empty plates are handled — the function
  returns the existing history without writing.
- `templates/report.html` —
    - Plate Overview now includes a **"Plate layout"** subsection
      with a colour-coded inline legend (Standards / Background /
      NC / Specimen) followed by the `plate_layout_html` heatmap.
    - Background QC section now has a **"Background MFI overview
      (all plates)"** subsection between the explainer and the
      table, gated on `bg_overview_present`. Short explanatory
      paragraph notes the antigen ordering and how to read the
      excluded-analyte cluster on the right.
    - The per-antigen Background table moved under a new
      `<h3>Per-antigen Background QC table</h3>` heading to make
      the new structure obvious.

**Smoke tests:**

- Pilot run on `Pilot_Uvira_XXL/`:
    - Plate-layout overview renders (`fig-plate-layout` div).
    - Background MFI overview renders (`fig-bg-overview` div); only
      one trace because no history yet.
    - `background_history.json` written (63 KB, 200 rows).
- Synthesised 3-plate test (`PLATE_01012026_RUN000`,
  `PLATE_02152026_RUN000`, `PLATE_03102026_RUN000`, with
  Background wells scaled ×1.0 / ×1.3 / ×0.85 respectively):
    - `background_history.json` ends at 600 rows = 200 antigens × 3
      plates. Dedup on `(plate_id, analyte)` working.
    - Plate 3's report shows three named traces in the BG overview
      legend: `PLATE_01012026_RUN000`, `PLATE_02152026_RUN000`, and
      `PLATE_03102026_RUN000 (current)`. Sorting puts the
      consistently noisy antigens on the left.

**Bug fix mid-session — plate layout + Background overview
weren't rendering in the browser.** Both figures emitted valid
Plotly JSON, but their `<script>Plotly.newPlot(...)</script>`
blocks sat at DOM lines ~4092 and ~4156 — earlier than the
bead-count heatmap at line ~7009. The inline Plotly.js library
bundle is embedded by `_plotly_html`'s first call (via
`include_plotlyjs=True`), and that first call was the **bead
heatmap**, putting the library bundle at line ~7009.  Result: the
plate-layout and BG-overview `newPlot` calls ran before
`window.Plotly` was defined and silently failed.

Fix: reorder the figure-build calls in `generate_report` to match
the template's section order (plate_layout → bg_overview →
bead_heatmap → …). Now the **plate-layout** figure is the first
`_plotly_html` call, so the Plotly.js bundle is embedded at line
~211 — well before any `newPlot` call. Verified after regenerate:
all three early figures render, library bundle at line ~211, every
`fig-*` div has populated trace data.

**Second mid-session iteration — Background MFI overview x-axis
was too squished, legend ate too much width.**

The 200 rotated antigen tick labels were unreadable even on the
single-plate report, and the right-hand vertical legend ate 15–20 %
of the plot width on the 3-plate report.

- `src/report.py::_make_background_overview_plot`:
  - Explicit figure `width = max(1400, n_antigens × 10)` (= 2000 px
    for the Uvira 200-antigen panel), `autosize=False`,
    `responsive=False`. Tick font 8 → 9 pt, height 440 → 520 px,
    bottom margin 160 → 180 px to give the rotated labels more
    room.
  - Legend re-oriented horizontally (`orientation="h"`) at
    `y=1.06, yanchor="bottom"` above the plot. Plates list left-to-
    right; the title reads "Plate (click to toggle):". The main
    panel now uses every pixel of width that the right-side
    vertical legend was holding.
  - Figure wrapped in `<div style="overflow-x:auto;">` so a 2000 px
    figure scrolls horizontally inside the section's normal width
    instead of overflowing on narrower screens.
- `src/report.py::_plotly_html`: new `responsive: bool = True` kwarg.
  All existing call sites still default to `True`; the BG-overview
  helper passes `responsive=False` so the explicit `width=` sticks
  (otherwise Plotly's responsive flag would shrink the figure back
  to its container width and reintroduce the squished labels).

Smoke-tested by regenerating both reports:
`~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/QC_PLATE_05112026_RUN000.html`
(pilot, single trace) and
`~/uvira-luminex-qc-results/smoke/QC_3plate_bg_overview.html`
(three traces side-by-side). Confirmed `"width":2000`,
`"orientation":"h"`, and one `overflow-x:auto` wrapper per report.

**Third mid-session iteration — drop the scroll behaviour and the
signal-magnitude sort.**

User pushback after the previous iteration: the page-wide horizontal
scroll wrapper around the BG-overview was disruptive (whole page
scrolled, not just the figure), and sorting antigens by max
Background MFI obscured the panel layout the user expects to see.

- `src/report.py::_make_background_overview_plot`:
  - **Antigen ordering** is now the panel order from the current
    plate's xPONENT CSV header (the order it appears in
    `history_background` for `current_plate_id`). Falls back to
    first-seen order in history when the current plate isn't in
    the frame. Analytes that only show up on past plates are
    appended in first-seen order. Excluded analytes stay in
    panel position (no longer pinned to the right) but are still
    italicised in the tick labels (Plotly accepts `<i>…</i>`
    inside tick labels — confirmed in JSON as `<i>…`).
  - **Static, responsive figure.** Dropped `width=2000`, dropped
    `autosize=False`, dropped the `<div style="overflow-x:auto">`
    wrapper. Tick font 9 → 6 pt; bottom margin 180 → 200 px;
    height 520 → 560 px to keep the rotated labels from clipping.
  - `_plotly_html(..., responsive=...)` call now uses the default
    `True` again — no per-figure override needed.
- `templates/report.html`: BG-overview caption rewritten — drops
  the "sorted by max MFI" / "excluded pinned right" language and
  notes that a given x-position now refers to the same bead region
  across plates.

Smoke-tested by regenerating both reports
(`QC_PLATE_05112026_RUN000.html`, `QC_3plate_bg_overview.html`).
Verified: no `"width":2000` in either, no `overflow-x:auto` in
either, tick font size 6 present, first six antigens on the
x-axis read `RES_Ade3, RES_Ade5_hexon, TOXO_TgAMA1,
RES_Ade40_hexon, VPD_B_pertussis_FHA, HHV_CMV` (= panel order),
and the three excluded analytes (`FLU_B_HA_Maryland_1959`,
`FLU_B_NP_Brisbane_2008`, `VPD_Tet_tox`) render as
`<i>…</i>`-wrapped tick labels.

**Carry-over to Session 11:** unchanged from Session 9 — Section 6
validation patient-ID spot-check and the actual macOS / Windows
builds when a release is needed.

### Session 9 — 2026-05-18 (Section 7: docs + packaging)

Closed out the long-running Section 7 — the migration's
documentation, packaging, and stray-reference cleanup. The
codebase is now self-consistently "Uvira 200-plex Intelliflex"
from `pyproject.toml` to the report footer.

**Files edited:**
- `README.md` — full rewrite. Drops the "migration in progress"
  banner and the MPXV 8-antigen / 4 kit-control table; introduces
  the Uvira 200-antigen panel by family prefix; describes the new
  QC stack end-to-end (`fit_ok` criteria, four-status range
  classification, summary thresholds, Background QC, NC QC); lists
  every per-plate CSV; updates the GitHub clone URL, app names
  (`Uvira Luminex QC.app`), and PyInstaller commands.
- `SPECIFICATION.md` — full rewrite. New "Plate Layout" section
  describes the Intelliflex / Uvira convention (Standard1–10 in
  A1–A10, Background in A11–A12, named NC patterns separate);
  documents the 200-antigen auto-derivation from the CSV header,
  the three soft-flagged excluded analytes, the four-status range
  table, the Background QC module, and the cross-plate JSON
  history files. Section "Reports" updated to match the current
  nine-section sidebar layout.
- `mpox-luminex-qc.spec` → **`uvira-luminex-qc.spec`** (macOS) and
  `mpox-luminex-qc-win.spec` → **`uvira-luminex-qc-win.spec`**.
  Product name `Uvira-Luminex-QC`, bundle name `Uvira Luminex QC.app`,
  bundle identifier `ch.unige.uvira-luminex-qc`. Hiddenimports
  refreshed: dropped `src.qc_kit_controls` and `src.qc_replicates`
  (deleted in Session 4); added `src.qc_background` (added in
  Session 6); added `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and
  `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg` since `_make_curve_grid`
  renders the small-multiples PNG via Matplotlib at report time.
  Removed `matplotlib` from the spec's `excludes` list.
- `templates/web/index.html` — footer GitHub URL swapped from
  `GenevaIDD/mpox-luminex-qc` → `GenevaIDD/uvira-luminex-qc`.
- `scripts/generate_test_data.py` — **deleted**. The script
  fabricated MagPix-shape 12-plex MPXV CSVs. Nothing references it
  anymore (no imports, no callers in README / SPEC / pyproject /
  app code), and Uvira testing uses the real pilot CSV.

**Smoke tests:**
- `grep -r 'mpox\\|MPXV\\|MagPix\\|12-plex' --include='*.md'
  --include='*.html' --include='*.spec' --include='*.toml'` — only
  legitimate explanatory references remain (README/SPEC mention the
  MagPix CSV header is still supported as a parser fallback; SPEC
  notes the MagPix-era `ITM PC / ITM PC2` pool concept that is no
  longer used on Uvira but whose dict structure is preserved
  internally). Confirmed clean otherwise.
- Both renamed `.spec` files parse as Python (`ast.parse`).
- Re-ran the full pipeline on `Pilot_Uvira_XXL/`. Report at 14 MB,
  every per-plate CSV emitted, no regressions.

**Remaining for Session 10:**
- Section 6 validation patient-ID spot-check (still open).
- Actually build the macOS `.app` and Windows `.exe` with the
  renamed specs when a release is needed.

### Session 8d — 2026-05-18 (picker UX iteration on the subplot)

User feedback on the Session-8c subplot picker, in order:

1. **Status-name annotations were overlapping** with each other and
   with the bottom x-axis tick labels (panel too narrow at 30%).
2. **Single-column rug**: the four BELOW / IN / ABOVE / NO_FIT status
   columns collapsed into a single "This plate" column with statuses
   stacked and colour-coded. The Past column stays as its own column.
   Percentages moved into a single multi-line summary text block.
3. **Rug too wide / summary blocked the curve**: rug narrowed
   further; summary pinned to the upper-right of the curve panel
   instead of upper-left.
4. **Legend too wide**: legend font shrunk and plate labels switched
   to a date-formatted short form for the legend (full label kept in
   hover + title).
5. **Status-count annotations weren't updating across antigens**:
   intro copy was stale (still talked about per-column updates after
   they had been collapsed) AND the JS used the undocumented merge
   behaviour of `Plotly.update`'s layout-update bag, which doesn't
   reliably replace the annotations array.

**Files edited:**
- `src/report.py::_make_curve_picker`
  - `column_widths` 0.78/0.22 → 0.70/0.30 → 0.82/0.18, final
    `horizontal_spacing=0.04`. Right margin trimmed 220 → 180 px to
    let the legend sit closer to the rug.
  - `RUG_X` table now puts **every** current-plate status at x=0 and
    the past column at x=1. Rug subplot range `[-0.5, 1.5]` (or
    `[-0.7, 0.7]` when there are no past plates). Dotted vertical
    separator at x=0.5 marks the boundary.
  - Rug subplot's bottom x-axis hidden (`showticklabels=false`,
    `showline=false`, no title, no grid). Column labels are the only
    things above the rug now.
  - `_rug_annotations(an)` returns three items: a multi-line summary
    text block (paper-anchored to upper-right of curve subplot, at
    `x=0.77, y=0.99, xanchor="right"`) listing the four status
    counts and percentages, plus "This plate" / "Past · N plates"
    column headers above the rug subplot in `x2` data coords.
  - Summary text block has white background + light border so it
    overlays cleanly on top of the gridlines.
- `src/report.py::_short_plate_label` (new) — extracts the date and
  run number from `PLATE_<MMDDYYYY>_RUN<NNN>` and emits
  `MM/DD/YYYY · R<N>` (+ ` · Box<N>` when a box xlsx is attached).
  Used for legend entries and the current-plate trace name; the full
  `_plate_label` is still used for hovers and the figure title.
- `src/report.py` legend layout — font size 11 → 10, title
  "Plates · click to toggle" in 10 pt grey, `tracegroupgap=2`,
  `itemsizing="constant"`.
- `src/report.py` JS shim — switched from one `Plotly.update(div,
  data, layout)` call to three explicit calls per antigen pick:
  `Plotly.restyle(div, {visible: …})`, then
  `Plotly.relayout(div, "title.text", …)`, then
  `Plotly.relayout(div, "annotations", …)`. The 3-arg `relayout`
  path form is the documented way to wholesale-replace a layout
  array; the previous bag form was relying on undocumented merge
  behaviour and silently kept the first analyte's annotations.
- `templates/report.html` Standard-Curve Picker intro fully
  rewritten to describe the new two-column rug, the
  upper-right status-count box, and the legend toggle behaviour. The
  earlier "count and percentage above each status column update as
  you switch antigens" sentence was stale and is gone.

**Smoke tests:**
- Pilot run: report at 14 MB. Layout uses `n_per_analyte = 6` (no
  past plates). Summary text shows `This plate · 84 specimens` with
  the four colour-coded status counts.
- Synthesised three plates (Box1 attached to all; Plate B specimens
  scaled +25%, Plate C scaled −25%):
  - Plate C report has 200 lookup entries, each with 3 annotations.
    110 distinct count vectors across the 200 antigens — confirms
    the per-antigen percentages do differ.
  - JS shim now uses
    `Plotly.relayout("fig-curve-picker", "annotations", entry.annotations)`
    (verified by grep).
  - Legend entries read e.g. `01/01/2026 · R0 · Box1` (short form);
    hover tooltip still shows
    `PLATE_01012026_RUN000 · Box1` (full form).

**Carry-over to Session 9:** unchanged.

### Session 8c — 2026-05-18 (curve-picker subplot + status columns)

Promoted the rug from an overlay on the curve to a dedicated subplot
panel, added per-status count + percentage annotations, and labelled
plates by `plate_id · Box{N}` everywhere they appear.

**Files edited:**
- `src/report.py` —
  - New `_plate_label(plate_id, box_ids)` helper. Handles the
    comma-string format used in history files and the list format
    used by the live `layout_info` dict. Shortens long Container Id
    values (e.g. `Box1_Uvira_sera_2023`) to the leading `Box\d+`
    portion via `_BOX_SHORT_RE`; falls back to the raw string when
    no `Box\d+` prefix is present.
  - `_hist_fits_by_analyte` now carries `box_ids` per past plate so
    the legend can compose `plate_id · Box{N}` without an extra
    lookup.
  - `_make_curve_picker` rebuilt around `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`
    (`column_widths=[0.78, 0.22]`, `shared_yaxes=True`):
    - **Left panel**: standards + current 4PL + grey historical 4PL
      curves (one trace per past plate).
    - **Right panel**: rug with categorical x-axis. Tick positions
      0–3 = BELOW / IN / ABOVE / NO_FIT for the current plate;
      tick position 5 = `Past` for all historical specimens.
      Position 4 left empty so a dotted vertical separator
      (paper-y shape) cleanly divides current from historical.
    - Above each of the four status columns sits a layout
      annotation: `BELOW`/`IN`/`ABOVE`/`NO FIT` (status colour) +
      `n (pct%)` underneath, computed from this plate's
      `in_range` for the selected antigen.
    - Annotations swapped via `Plotly.update("…annotations": …)`
      when the typeahead changes antigen. Subplot titles preserved
      across switches by keeping them as the first two entries of
      the annotation array.
- `src/pipeline.py` —
  - `_build_specimen_mfi_history` now carries `box_id` from
    `in_range` into the JSON, so the past-plate legend label can
    look it up later.
  - `_build_fit_history` accepts a new `box_ids=` kwarg (joined
    comma-string of all boxes on the plate). `run_pipeline` derives
    it from `data["box_id"]` before the call.

**Smoke tests:**
- Pilot run: report at 14 MB, subplot scaffolding present
  (`"Specimen MFI rug"` subplot title), 4 rug status ticks, no
  past-plate traces (P = 0).
- Three synthesised plates (`PLATE_01012026_RUN000` /
  `PLATE_02152026_RUN000` / `PLATE_03102026_RUN000`, all attached
  to `Box1`, second plate scaled +25%, third scaled −25%):
  - Plate 3's report shows the two prior plates as legend entries
    labelled `PLATE_01012026_RUN000 · Box1` and
    `PLATE_02152026_RUN000 · Box1`. Current 4PL legend reads
    `This plate (PLATE_03102026_RUN000 · Box1)`.
  - Per-antigen annotation block carries 4 status entries; first
    annotation text is `<b style='color:#4477AA;'>BELOW</b>
    <br><span style='font-size:10px;color:#34495e;'>{n} ({pct}%)</span>`
    confirming the swap structure.
  - Legend toggle still works: clicking a past plate hides both
    its 4PL trace (left subplot) and its rug points (right
    subplot) because they share `legendgroup="plate:<plate_id>"`.

**Carry-over to Session 9:** unchanged from 8b.

### Session 8b — 2026-05-18 (curve-picker refinements)

Three follow-ups on the Session-8 rug + historical overlay:

1. **Rug overlap.** Bumped `rug_x_current` to `x_max × 2.0` and
   `rug_x_hist` to `x_max × 2.6` (was 1.18 / 1.27). Added an explicit
   x-axis `range=[log10(x_min × 0.7), log10(x_max × 3.5)]` so the rugs
   render in the padded area and never clip. Right margin grew from
   30 px → 220 px to accommodate the legend.
2. **Z-order.** Trace slot order rewritten: historical curves
   (`[0 .. P-1]`), historical rugs (`[P .. 2P-1]`), then current
   standards / fit / 4 status rugs (`[2P .. 2P+5]`). Plotly draws in
   addition order, so historical now sits behind the live overlay.
3. **Per-plate legend toggling.** Each past plate gets a single
   legend entry (one curve trace shown in the legend, its rug trace
   hidden but sharing `legendgroup="plate:<plate_id>"`). Clicking the
   legend entry hides every overlay for that plate across every
   antigen; double-click isolates. `plot_layout.legend.title` reads
   "Plates (click to toggle)" when ≥1 past plate is present.

**Files edited:**
- `src/report.py::_make_curve_picker` — full rewrite of trace order
  and per-plate slot allocation. New `past_plates` roster computed
  once (chronological by `run_date` when available) and used for
  every analyte. `n_per_analyte = 2P + 6`; layout call passes the
  padded x range and the new `legend_layout` dict.
- `templates/report.html` — picker intro adds the legend / double-
  click instruction and a short note explaining that history is per
  output directory (first plate has no grey overlay; subsequent
  plates accumulate).

**Smoke tests:**
- Pilot (no past plates): 15 MB report. Layout uses `n_per_analyte =
  2×0 + 6 = 6`. Legend shows the current-plate entries only ("This
  plate (PLATE_05112026_RUN000)", "Standards").
- Synthesised three plates A → B → C (B scaled +20%, C scaled −20%
  on specimens). Plate C's report contains 400 trace references
  each for PLATE_A and PLATE_B (200 analytes × 2 slot kinds per
  past plate), `legendgroup="plate:PLATE_A"` (and B) populated, and
  the legend-title string is present. Verified Plate C's grey
  overlays sit behind the blue current curve and the current-plate
  rug column doesn't overlap the rightmost standard point.

**Workflow note** (added to the picker intro): history is per
output directory — the first plate has no grey overlay; every
subsequent plate processed into the same directory becomes a
toggleable legend entry. To start fresh, delete the corresponding
`history/` subdirectory.

### Session 8 — 2026-05-18

Curve-picker rug + cross-plate overlays — the deferred Session-7
follow-up. The picker now shows where the current plate's specimens
sit on the y-axis (colored by BELOW / IN / ABOVE / NO_FIT), plus
prior-plate specimens and curves in grey so drift across runs is
visible without flipping between reports.

**Files edited:**
- `src/pipeline.py` —
  - New helper `_build_specimen_mfi_history(metadata, in_range)`.
    One row per (`plate_id`, `well`, `analyte`) with `mfi` and
    `status` from the current run. Drops NaN MFI rows.
  - `run_pipeline` reads / appends / writes
    `<history_dir>/specimen_mfi_history.json`, dedup key
    `[plate_id, well, analyte]`. `history_specimens` flows through
    to the report whether or not the current plate contributed
    rows (so prior plates still render after a no-NC-no-spec run).
  - `generate_report` call now also passes `history_fit`
    (already loaded earlier in the pipeline for `fit_history_PC.json`).
- `src/report.py` —
  - `generate_report` signature gains `history_fit=` and
    `history_specimens=` keyword args.
  - New `_hist_fits_by_analyte(history_fit, current_plate_id)`
    flattens the per-pool DataFrame into
    `{analyte: [{plate_id, params: (a, b, c, d)}, …]}` and excludes
    the current plate.
  - `_make_curve_picker` rewritten. Fixed `TRACES_PER_ANALYTE = 8`
    slot layout per analyte so the typeahead visibility array
    stays dense and predictable:
    - 0 — current standards (markers)
    - 1 — current 4PL fit (blue line)
    - 2–5 — current specimens, one rug trace per
      BELOW_RANGE / IN_RANGE / ABOVE_RANGE / NO_FIT status,
      colored from the CB-safe range-matrix palette
      (#4477AA / #44AA99 / #EE7733 / #CCBB44)
    - 6 — historical specimens rug (grey, plate name in hover)
    - 7 — historical 4PL curves (grey dotted line; all prior
      plates concatenated with `None` segment breaks).
  - Rugs sit at `x = max(std_dilution) × 1.18` (current) and
    `× 1.27` (historical) so the two columns are visually
    distinct on the log axis.
  - Typeahead lookup updated to flip all 8 slots per analyte
    instead of just 0–1; initial visibility likewise.
- `templates/report.html` — Standard-Curve Picker intro rewritten
  to introduce the two rugs and the grey-historical convention,
  with inline badges showing each status colour.

**Smoke tests:**
- Pilot plate (fresh history): `specimen_mfi_history.json` written
  (3.5 MB, 16,800 rows = 84 specimens × 200 antigens). HTML at
  15 MB (was 12 MB) — extra trace bookkeeping. 800 status-rug
  traces in JSON (200 antigens × 4 statuses); 200 "Past plates"
  + 200 "Past curves" traces (empty for the first plate; non-empty
  on subsequent runs).
- Synthesised two plates (`HIST_A`, `HIST_B`, scaled Plate B's
  specimen MFI by 1.3×) by monkey-patching `parse_xponent_csv`:
  - After Plate A: history file has 16,800 rows / 1 plate.
  - After Plate B: history file has 33,600 rows / 2 plates.
  - Plate B's report contains "Past plates" + "Past curves" trace
    names; the embedded JSON contains 16,800 `HIST_A`
    references inside Past-plate `customdata` arrays.
  - Past curves rendered as grey dotted lines; current curve still
    blue. Past specimens as grey ticks slightly outside the
    current-plate rug column.

**Carry-over to Session 9:**
- Section 6 validation patient-ID spot-check.
- Section 7 (original): rewrite README / SPEC for the Uvira
  assay, rename PyInstaller specs, update GitHub URLs in
  templates / footer / README.

### Session 7b — 2026-05-18 (continuation)

Small follow-up: ported the legacy MPOX cross-plate NC history so that
when a future plate has a named NC sample, drift across runs is
visible in the report.

**Files edited:**
- `src/pipeline.py` —
  - New helper `_build_nc_history(metadata, nc_levels)` returns one
    row per (`plate_id`, `well`, `analyte`) with the NC well's MFI.
  - `run_pipeline` now loads `<history_dir>/nc_well_history.json`,
    appends the current plate's NC rows (dedup on
    `[plate_id, well, analyte]` via `append_history`), and saves
    back. When the current plate has no NC wells the existing
    history is still loaded and passed through so the report can
    show prior plates.
  - `history_nc` now flows through to `generate_report` as a
    `DataFrame` instead of `None`.
- `src/report.py` — new `_make_nc_history_plot(history_nc,
  current_plate_id)`: aggregates to per-(plate × analyte) mean MFI
  and renders a Purples heatmap. Plates ordered by `run_date` when
  present; the current plate gets a `(current)` suffix on its row
  label. Empty / no-history → empty string, template hides the
  subsection. Wired into `generate_report` via `nc_history_html` and
  `nc_history_present`.
- `templates/report.html` — added an "NC MFI across plates"
  subsection inside the NC QC section, rendered only when
  `nc_history_present`. NC explainer banner gained a fifth bullet
  noting that NC MFI is persisted to a cross-plate history JSON.

**Smoke tests:**
- Real pilot plate (no NC wells): JSON not written; history section
  correctly hidden in the report. No regression.
- Synthesised two test plates (`TEST_PLATE_A`, `TEST_PLATE_B`) by
  monkey-patching `parse_xponent_csv` to relabel `A11` as
  `NC_pool` and to inject a small drift on RES_* antigens for
  Plate B. After two runs:
  - `nc_well_history.json` contains 400 rows (200 antigens × 2
    plates), no duplicates.
  - Plate B's report contains "NC MFI across plates",
    `fig-nc-history`, `TEST_PLATE_A`, and `TEST_PLATE_B (current)`.
  - The injected drift surfaces as a per-plate mean MFI bump
    (132.4 → 141.4 across the panel).

### Session 7 — 2026-05-18

Polish pass on the Session-6 report.  Several rounds of user feedback
on copy clarity, section order, and the curve picker UI.

**Files edited:**
- `src/report.py` —
  - `_make_bead_heatmap` group separators now drawn as
    `add_shape(yref="paper", y0=0, y1=1.08)` so the dotted lines
    extend above the heatmap into the x-tick label band instead of
    stopping at the plot edge.
  - `_make_curve_picker` rewritten: the Plotly `updatemenus` dropdown
    was removed entirely (it duplicated the new typeahead). An HTML5
    `<datalist>`-backed `<input>` sits above the figure; a tiny JS
    shim reads a per-antigen `{vis, title}` lookup and calls
    `Plotly.update("fig-curve-picker", …)` on `change`/`input`. The
    lookup is embedded as a JS object literal with `</` escaped, so
    nothing leaks out of the `<script>` block.
- `templates/report.html` —
  - **Section reorder.** New order: Plate Overview → Negative
    Control QC → Background QC → Bead-Count Matrix → Standard-Curve
    Summary → All Curves Overview → Standard-Curve Picker → Range
    Matrix → Downloads. NC + BG QC moved up from the bottom; sidebar
    TOC mirrors the new order.
  - "Negative-Control Levels" renamed to **Negative Control QC**.
  - Every top-level `<details class="section">` now has the `open`
    attribute by default.
  - Sidebar JS at end of `<body>`: listens for `<nav.sidebar a>`
    clicks + `hashchange` and force-opens the targeted `<details>`,
    then smooth-scrolls to it. Section nav always lands on visible
    content even if the user has manually collapsed something.
  - **Bead summary cards** split into four cards with consistent
    typography (Antigens flagged / Specimens flagged / Red cells /
    Yellow cells), each with a one-line subtitle naming the criterion.
  - **Range summary cards moved** from "All Curves Overview" into
    "Standard-Curve Summary" (the natural home — the summary table is
    right there).
  - New **"What does Fit OK mean?"** banner in Standard-Curve Summary
    listing all four pass criteria (R² ≥ 0.95 on log10, IC50 inside
    the tested dilution range with ±3× margin, Hill slope 0.3–5.0,
    dynamic range ≥ 3×).
  - New **"How Background QC works"** banner in Background QC
    explaining Mean / %CV / Max checks in plain English, with the
    live `bg_cv_pct` and `bg_max_mfi` thresholds inlined.
  - **Downloads section reorganised**. Buttons grouped by section
    (NC QC → Background QC → Bead-Count Matrix → Standard-Curve
    Summary → Range Matrix → Specimens cross-cutting), one row per
    button with a plain-English description of the CSV's contents.
    NC group only renders when the plate has NC wells. Added the
    long-form `bead_problems_*.csv` button that was previously
    missing from the page.
  - Curve-picker introductory copy updated: "Pick an antigen either
    by typing in the search box (with autocomplete) or via the
    dropdown menu above the plot." → "Pick an antigen by typing in
    the search box (with autocomplete)."

**Smoke tests:**
- Full pipeline ran cleanly on `Pilot_Uvira_XXL/`. Report at
  ~12 MB. Section-order grep confirmed Plate Overview → NC QC →
  Background QC → Bead-Count → … → Downloads in that order. No
  duplicate `sec-nc` / `sec-bg` blocks. Sidebar JS present
  (`openTarget` defined, click + `hashchange` listeners wired).
  All five `<h4>` Downloads groups render in section order.
- Typeahead manually tested: typing a partial name pops the
  matching analyte via the datalist; selection triggers
  `Plotly.update` and the figure swaps to that analyte's curve
  + standards. No matching name shows a "no match" hint instead
  of breaking. Dropdown is gone from the picker layout (the lone
  remaining `updatemenus` string in the HTML is inside the
  embedded plotly.js bundle, not our figure).

**Known follow-ups (closed in Session 8 unless noted):**
- ~~Curve-picker rug plot~~ — done Session 8.
- ~~Historical curves + rugs in grey~~ — done Session 8.
- ~~Specimen-MFI history JSON~~ — done Session 8.
- Section 6 validation patient-ID spot-check (still open).
- Section 7 (the original): rewrite README / SPEC, rename
  PyInstaller specs, update GitHub URLs in templates / footer
  (still open).

### Session 6 — 2026-05-18

User-driven usability pass on the Session-5 report.  Most of Section 8
landed; the historical-overlay items (curve picker rug + grey
historical curves) are explicitly deferred to Session 7.

**Files added / edited:**
- `src/config.py` — new `PROBLEM_FRACTION_THRESHOLD = 0.20`,
  `BG_CV_THRESHOLD = 0.25`, `BG_MAX_MFI = 100`. Surfaced through
  `DEFAULTS["qc_thresholds"]`. `well_classification.background_patterns`
  added.
- `src/qc_background.py` (new) — `qc_background_levels(df, cv_threshold,
  max_mfi_threshold, excluded_analytes)` returns per-antigen
  `n_wells / mean_mfi / sd_mfi / cv / max_mfi / cv_flag / max_flag /
  excluded`.
- `src/qc_beads.py` — added `bead_problem_summary(bead_qc, well_types,
  fraction_threshold)`. Returns per-antigen and per-sample summaries
  (count + list of problem wells / analytes). Sample summary counts
  only specimens (Standards / Background / NC excluded from the
  denominator).
- `src/qc_standard_curve.py` — added `range_problem_summary(in_range,
  fraction_threshold, excluded_analytes)`. Returns four counts
  (antigens below / above; samples below / above) plus the detail
  rows for each axis.
- `src/report.py` —
  - Imported the two new helpers + `qc_background_levels`.
  - `generate_report` now computes summaries, formats them via
    `_format_bead_summary`, `_format_range_summary`,
    `_format_bg_levels`, and passes everything through.
  - `_make_in_range_heatmap` recoloured to a CB-safe four-stop scale
    (BELOW = #4477AA, IN = #44AA99, ABOVE = #EE7733, NO_FIT =
    #CCBB44). Grey reserved for historical overlays.
  - `_make_bead_heatmap` now takes `well_types=` and draws dotted
    vertical lines between well-type groups via `_group_boundaries`.
- `src/pipeline.py` — computes the three new summaries (bead, range,
  background) and exports five new CSVs:
  `bead_problem_antigens_<plate>.csv`,
  `bead_problem_samples_<plate>.csv`,
  `range_problem_antigens_<plate>.csv`,
  `range_problem_samples_<plate>.csv`,
  `background_qc_<plate>.csv`.
- `templates/report.html` — full body rewrite. Two-column layout with
  a sticky `<nav class="sidebar">` TOC plus a `<main class="content">`
  containing nine `<details class="section">` blocks (one per section),
  all collapsible. New `.stat-row` / `.stat` summary cards at the top
  of the bead-count, all-curves, and background sections. New
  `badge-r-below / -r-in / -r-above / -r-nofit` CSS classes matching
  the recoloured heatmap. New section: **Background QC** (between NC
  and Downloads), with three summary cards and a per-antigen table
  (n wells / mean / SD / %CV / max / flags). Downloads section
  expanded with the five new CSV buttons.
- `templates/web/settings.html` — added Background pattern field
  separately from NC; added `problem_fraction_threshold`,
  `bg_cv_threshold`, `bg_max_mfi` inputs.
- `src/app.py::save_settings` — parses `background_patterns` and the
  three new thresholds.

**Smoke test on `Pilot_Uvira_XXL/`:**

Full pipeline ran clean. Report at 12.3 MB. Output:
- `bead_problem_antigens_*.csv` (200×7): 7 antigens flagged
  (≥ 20% of wells problematic).
- `bead_problem_samples_*.csv` (84×8): 6 specimens flagged
  (≥ 20% of antigens problematic).
- `range_problem_antigens_*.csv` (200×11): 7 below_flag,
  41 above_flag.
- `range_problem_samples_*.csv` (84×11): 3 below_flag,
  14 above_flag.
- `background_qc_*.csv` (200×9): 0 CV-flagged, 93 max-flagged at
  the default `bg_max_mfi=100`. The default is aggressive for this
  panel — user can raise it on the Settings page.

HTML contains 9 `<details class="section">` blocks, a sidebar with
9 section links, and 10 summary stat cards. Dotted group separators
visible in the bead-count heatmap between A1-A10 (Standards) and
A11-A12 (Background) and at A12 → B1 (specimens). New CB-safe
palette swatches (#4477AA / #44AA99 / #EE7733 / #CCBB44) appear in
the range matrix.

**Deferred to Session 7 (explicit scope cut):**
- Curve-picker rug plot of specimen MFI colored by status.
- Curve-picker grey overlays of every previous plate's curve.
- A new specimen-MFI history JSON to feed the historical rug.

These three are coupled (same panel) and need their own design pass —
specifically: what plate identifier to use, how to throttle the rug
on antigens with hundreds of historical specimens, and how to handle
the case where the per-plate antigen panel changes over time.

### Session 5 — 2026-05-18

Two user-driven adjustments to the Section-5 report.

**1. Range classification — 3-state instead of binary.**
`compute_in_range_table` now emits `IN_RANGE` / `BELOW_RANGE` /
`ABOVE_RANGE` / `NO_FIT` (decision #3 reversed). Below-LLOQ and
above-ULOQ are distinct so users can tell which tail of the curve a
specimen falls off.

- `src/qc_standard_curve.py` —
  - `compute_in_range_table`: classify `mfi < lloq` as `BELOW_RANGE`
    and `mfi > uloq` as `ABOVE_RANGE`.
  - `compute_pct_in_range_per_antigen`: split `n_out_of_range` into
    `n_below_range` and `n_above_range`. `pct_in_range` formula
    unchanged.
- `src/report.py::_make_in_range_heatmap`: rewrote the colorscale to
  4 stops — BELOW = blue (#3498db), IN = pale neutral (#ecf0f1),
  ABOVE = orange (#e67e22), NO_FIT = grey (#7f8c8d). User chose this
  scheme to keep red/green out of the heatmap.
- `src/report.py::_format_range_problems`: include `status` column,
  filter on `status in {BELOW_RANGE, ABOVE_RANGE}`.
- `templates/report.html`: section retitled "Standard-Curve Range
  Matrix"; badges and legend rewritten; detail list shows a BELOW /
  ABOVE badge per row.

**2. Negative-control tracking.**
Background wells (`^Background`, A11/A12) and NC wells (`^NC` /
`^Negative`) are now distinct well types. The pilot plate has only
Background, so the NC report section renders a "No NC wells on this
plate" banner; future plates can drop in a sample named `NC1` /
`Negative_pool` and the section will populate automatically.

- `src/config.py`: added `BACKGROUND_PATTERNS = [r"^Background"]`;
  `NC_PATTERNS = [r"^NC", r"^Negative"]`. `DEFAULTS.well_classification`
  gained `background_patterns`.
- `src/classify.py`: `_classify_sample` returns `pc` / `background` /
  `nc` / `specimen` (3-way match before specimen fallback).
- `src/qc_nc.py` (new): `qc_nc_levels(df)` returns `[well,
  sample_name, analyte, mfi]` filtered to `well_type == "nc"`. Empty
  frame when no NC wells.
- `src/pipeline.py`: calls `qc_nc_levels`, passes to `generate_report`,
  exports `nc_levels_<plate>.csv` only when non-empty.
- `src/report.py::_make_nc_heatmap`: Purples MFI heatmap per (well ×
  analyte). Returns empty string when no NC wells, and the template
  renders the banner.
- `templates/report.html`: new "Negative-Control Levels" section
  between the range matrix and Downloads.
- `src/report.py::generate_report`: signature now takes `nc_levels=`
  and `n_nc_wells` / `nc_present` flow into the template.

**Smoke tests run:**
- Imports OK after refactor.
- `classify_wells` on a 4-row fixture: Standard1 → pc, Background0 →
  background, FD123 → specimen, NC_pool → nc.
- `compute_in_range_table` on a 4-row fixture: BELOW_RANGE,
  IN_RANGE, ABOVE_RANGE, NO_FIT all produced as expected; summary row
  has all four count columns.
- **Full pipeline run on `Pilot_Uvira_XXL/`**: report renders at 12.4
  MB in well under a minute on the local 3.13 venv. CSV status
  distribution: 13,625 IN_RANGE / 2,159 ABOVE_RANGE / 764 BELOW_RANGE
  / 252 NO_FIT (= 84 × 3 excluded analytes, as expected). HTML
  contains 2× "Standard-Curve Range Matrix", 766× `badge-blue`,
  2,161× `badge-orange`, 2× `badge-neutral`, 2× `badge-slate`, and
  the "No negative-control wells" banner.
- The lone residual `OUT_OF_RANGE` string in the HTML is inside the
  embedded plotly.js minified bundle (unrelated).

**Known follow-ups:**
- Section 6 validation patient-ID spot-check still outstanding.
- Section 7 docs/PyInstaller specs still outstanding.
- NC threshold flagging deferred per decision #6.
- Settings page does not yet expose the new `background_patterns`
  field (current default works for all pilot plates; revisit if a
  future plate needs custom Background naming).

### Session 4 — 2026-05-14

Implemented Sections 4 and 5. The pipeline now produces a fully
functional Uvira 200-plex HTML report end-to-end on the pilot data.
Legacy MagPix-only modules removed.

**Files added / rewritten:**
- `src/qc_beads.py` — fully rewritten. New return shape:
  `matrix` (analyte × well counts), `tier_matrix` (red/yellow/green),
  `sample_labels`, `problems` (long-format, sorted red-first), plus the
  legacy `flagged` / `n_flagged` / `by_well` fields for any code that
  still expects them. Tier classifier reads
  `qc_thresholds.bead_count_min` (red below) and `bead_count_warn`
  (yellow below; green above) — both editable from Settings.
- `src/report.py` — fully rewritten (≈400 lines, down from 813).
  Six-section Uvira layout (Plate Overview, Bead-Count Matrix,
  Standard-Curve Summary, Standard-Curve Picker, IN/OUT-of-Range
  Matrix, Downloads). Three Plotly figures (`_make_bead_heatmap`,
  `_make_curve_picker`, `_make_in_range_heatmap`); Plotly is loaded
  once via CDN at the top of the template. The curve picker bundles
  all 200 antigens as visibility-toggled traces with a single
  `updatemenus` dropdown.
- `templates/report.html` — fully rewritten. New CSS, semantic
  sections, sticky-header tables, muted-row styling for excluded
  analytes, downloadable CSV buttons.
- `src/pipeline.py` — dropped `qc_pc_replicates`, `qc_nc_levels`,
  `qc_kit_controls` calls and their imports. `generate_report` now
  receives the new args (`in_range`, `pct_in_range`) and the
  try/except wrapper from Session 3 is removed (the pipeline now
  expects the report to succeed). Bead-problem CSV export added
  (`bead_problems_<plate>.csv`). `_build_nc_history` deleted.
  `history_nc` is `None`.
- `src/qc_kit_controls.py`, `src/qc_nc.py`, `src/qc_replicates.py` —
  **deleted**.
- `src/config.py` — deprecated kit-control aliases (`MPXV_ANTIGENS`,
  `MPXV_KIT_CONTROLS`, `NC_BEAD_MFI_MAX`, `SCG_MFI_MIN`,
  `FC_MFI_RANGE`, `IC_MFI_RANGE`) removed; nothing imports them
  anymore.
- All `src/*.py` — `from __future__ import annotations` added so the
  modules parse on Python 3.9+ (project still officially requires
  3.11; this is purely defensive).

**Bug fixes during smoke-test verification:**
- **Plotly version skew** — plotly Python 6.x emits JSON for
  plotly.js 3.x but the template was loading a hardcoded
  plotly.js 2.27 CDN tag, so the three figures silently failed to
  render. Fixed by switching to `include_plotlyjs=True` on the first
  figure (embeds the matching v3.5.0 bundle inline) and `False` on
  the rest. Stale CDN `<script>` tag removed from `report.html`.
  Result is fully self-contained — no internet required, no version
  drift — at the cost of ~+4.6 MB per report. A
  `_reset_plotlyjs_embed_flag()` call at the top of
  `generate_report` ensures successive reports each get their own
  inline bundle.
- **Standard-curve perf** — `_fit_one` already had a degenerate-input
  guard (max-MFI floor) but `_try_drop_one_outlier` was still called
  on every failed fit, running 10 extra scipy passes per analyte
  with no signal. Now retry is gated on `params is not None` (i.e.,
  scipy converged but QC criteria failed). On the pilot data, the
  end-to-end wall clock should drop substantially from ~6:40.
- **4PL fit quality** (user reported HCoV_OC43_NP with `d=0` and a
  visibly bad lower tail) — root cause was linear-residual fitting.
  The upper plateau (~10⁵ MFI) dominates absolute residuals, so the
  optimizer "ignored" tail points at MFI ~80 and landed at `d=0`.
  Switched `_fit_one` to fit on log10(MFI), matching standard
  immunoassay practice; R² and the retry path's selection metric now
  use the same log-space objective. Also fixed misleading
  `a_init` / `d_init` variable comments (the math was always right
  because both have the same `[0, ∞)` bounds, but the comments
  swapped what each represents). X-axis label clarified from
  `Dilution (1:x)` → `Dilution factor (1 : x)`.

**Smoke tests run:**
- `qc_bead_counts` on the pilot data: matrix shape `(200, 96)`,
  430 red cells, 856 yellow cells, 1,286 problem rows. The three
  excluded bead regions consistently show 0 beads across every well
  (consistent with their being added in error).
- **Render-only end-to-end** (`/tmp/uvira_smoke_render.py`):
  parse → layout merge → bead-QC → synthetic 4PL fits → range tables
  → `report.generate_report` → 6.3 MB self-contained HTML. All 13
  grep markers hit (UI sections present, excluded analyte rendered,
  Box xlsx + barcode + IN_RANGE/OUT_OF_RANGE language present, no
  residual MPXV / kit-control / NC-bead strings). Synthetic fits used
  to bypass `scipy.curve_fit` because the system Python 3.9 used in
  this dev env is far slower than the project's pinned 3.11 + scipy
  ≥ 1.11. **Full scipy-fit pass on the project's 3.11 still to be
  done by the user** — `uv run python -m src.main`, then upload the
  pilot CSV / inputfile / Box xlsx through the web UI.
- `_fit_one` was given a **degenerate-input guard** (max-MFI floor +
  flat-response check) to keep `scipy.curve_fit` from thrashing on
  all-zero noise channels (the three excluded bead regions and any
  similar low-signal antigens). `maxfev` lowered 50,000 → 10,000.
- **Full real-scipy run** on pilot data: 6:40 wall clock initially;
  after the perf gating above, much faster. Output:
  - HTML 11 MB (with embedded plotly.js)
  - `specimens_*.csv` 2.5 MB
  - `in_range_*.csv` 2.3 MB
  - `pct_in_range_*.csv` 8 KB
  - `bead_problems_*.csv` 52 KB

  Real-fit `pct_in_range` distribution: median 86.9%, mean 74.2%.
  195/200 antigens have at least one specimen in range. The three
  excluded analytes all correctly show 0 IN_RANGE / 84 NO_FIT.

**Known follow-ups (Section 6 / 7):**
- Section 6 validation cross-check (a handful of patient IDs) still to
  do — the wiring is in place; just need to spot-check a few wells.
- Section 7: legacy descriptive copy in README.md and SPECIFICATION.md
  still describes the MPXV 12-plex assay; the GitHub URL in the
  templates/footer still points at the old repo; PyInstaller specs
  not yet renamed.
- The `KIT_CONTROLS = []` constant and the kit-control branch in
  `qc_standard_curve._fit_one`'s pool-discovery code are dead and
  could be simplified further.

**Next session:** Section 6 (validation pass with patient-ID
spot-check) and Section 7 (rewrite README / SPEC, update repo URLs,
rename PyInstaller specs).

### Session 3 — 2026-05-14

Implemented Sections 2 and 3. Pipeline now produces the Section-3
deliverable CSVs end-to-end on the pilot data; HTML report rendering
remains the Section-5 task.

**Files edited:**
- `src/config.py` — added `BEAD_COUNT_WARN = 50` to `DEFAULTS`. Re-added
  the deprecated kit-control thresholds (`NC_BEAD_MFI_MAX`,
  `SCG_MFI_MIN`, `FC_MFI_RANGE`, `IC_MFI_RANGE`) as module-level
  constants so legacy `qc_kit_controls.py` and `report.py` keep
  importing during the Section-5 transition.
- `src/parse_xponent.py` — `metadata['analytes']` now carries the
  per-plate panel in the order the instrument exported it.
- `src/qc_standard_curve.py` — `fit_standard_curves` accepts an
  `antigens=` kwarg. Two new functions:
  - `compute_in_range_table(data, fits, excluded_analytes)` →
    long-format `(well × analyte)` table with MFI, MFI bounds, ternary
    `status`, `excluded` flag, and any sample-id / barcode / patient-id
    columns from the layout merge.
  - `compute_pct_in_range_per_antigen(in_range, excluded_analytes)`
    → per-antigen summary with `n_samples / n_in_range /
    n_out_of_range / n_no_fit / pct_in_range / excluded`.
  - Helper `_mfi_bounds_for_fit(fit_result)` evaluates the 4PL at the
    LLOQ/ULOQ dilutions to get MFI bounds for the IN/OUT decision.
- `src/pipeline.py` — uses `metadata['analytes']` as the authoritative
  panel for `fit_standard_curves`; calls the two new range functions
  using `get_excluded_analytes(config)`; exports
  `in_range_<plate>.csv` and `pct_in_range_<plate>.csv`. The
  `generate_report` call is now wrapped in try/except — when it fails
  (expected during Section-5 transition) a placeholder HTML is written
  so Past Reports still has a row, and the pipeline carries on to
  produce the CSVs.
- `templates/web/settings.html` — replaced. Per-antigen / kit-control
  table editors removed (panel is auto-derived). New
  `excluded_analytes` textarea (newline-separated), `bead_count_warn`
  input, simplified standard-dilutions field. Legacy
  `nc_bead_mfi_max` / `scg_mfi_min` / `fc_mfi_*` / `ic_mfi_*` /
  `pc_cv_threshold` / `dilution_mode` fields removed from the UI.
- `src/app.py` — `save_settings` rewritten to match the new form:
  parses `excluded_analytes`, `bead_count_warn`, single
  `standard_dilutions` field; drops the per-row antigen / kit-control
  iteration and the kit-control range parsers.
- `UVIRA_TODO.md` — Sections 2 and 3 marked done (curve-plot rendering
  deferred to Section 5).

**Smoke tests run:**
- `parse_xponent_csv()` on pilot CSV: `metadata['analytes']` carries
  all 200 names in order.
- `compute_in_range_table()` with synthetic 4PL fits derived from the
  standard MFI bounds: 16,800 rows = 84 specimens × 200 antigens;
  status counts split 14,723 IN_RANGE / 2,077 OUT_OF_RANGE; 252 rows
  flagged `excluded=True` (84 × 3 erroneous beads).
- `compute_pct_in_range_per_antigen()`: 200 rows; the three excluded
  bead regions show 0–3.6% in-range (correctly the worst), good
  antigens like `RES_Ade3` show 97.6%.

**Known follow-ups (NOT done in Session 3):**
- `report.py` not rewritten yet — still imports kit-control constants
  and tries to render an 8-antigen layout. Pipeline now swallows the
  resulting error and writes a placeholder. Section 5 owns the rewrite.
- `qc_kit_controls.py`, `qc_nc.py`, `qc_replicates.py` still called
  from `pipeline.py` — they return empty/safe results on Uvira data
  but should be deleted in Section 5.
- Bead-count Red/Yellow/Green matrix and problem list (Section 4) not
  yet built. The thresholds (`bead_count_min`, `bead_count_warn`) are
  in config and editable from Settings; the matrix-building helper
  is the Section-4 task.

**Next session:** Section 4 (bead-count matrix + problem list) and the
start of Section 5 (200-antigen report layout).

### Session 2 — 2026-05-13

Implemented Sections 0 and 1 (foundation only — report rendering stays
broken for Uvira data until Section 5).

**Files edited:**
- `src/config.py` — fully rewritten. `ANTIGENS` is the 200-name Uvira
  panel pulled from the pilot CSV header; `KIT_CONTROLS = []`;
  `EXCLUDED_ANALYTES = [FLU_B_HA_Maryland_1959, FLU_B_NP_Brisbane_2008,
  VPD_Tet_tox]`; `STANDARD_DILUTIONS` baked in as the 10-point 4-fold
  series from the screenshot (62.5 → 16,384,000); new `PC_PATTERNS =
  ['^Standard\d+$']` and `NC_PATTERNS = ['^Background']`; new
  `BEAD_COUNT_WARN = 50` threshold; `RESULTS_DIR_NAME =
  'uvira-luminex-qc-results'`; `APP_VERSION = '0.9.0-uvira'`. Kit-control
  kit-bead defaults removed. `MPXV_ANTIGENS` / `MPXV_KIT_CONTROLS` kept
  as deprecated aliases.
- `src/settings.py` — uses `RESULTS_DIR_NAME`; new
  `get_excluded_analytes()` accessor.
- `src/classify.py` — new `^Standard\d+$` PC pattern, `^Background` NC
  pattern; dropped `pc_pool`; PC dilution looked up by Standard index
  into `STANDARD_DILUTIONS`.
- `src/parse_xponent.py` — handles Intelliflex `Program` field
  (captures `instrument_program`), additional `DataType:` blocks,
  `PanelName` / `BatchDescription` / `BatchStopTime` metadata. Metadata
  scan stops at first `DataType:`. Plate-ID fallback uses the raw batch
  string when the `-Plate\d+` pattern doesn't match.
- `src/parse_layout.py` — replaced. New `read_inputfile_csv()`,
  `read_box_xlsx()`, `build_layout()`. Old `read_plate_layout(path)`
  kept as a backward-compat wrapper.
- `src/pipeline.py` — `run_pipeline()` takes new `inputfile_path` kwarg;
  when present, layout merge routes through `build_layout` and yields
  `sample_id` / `barcode` / `patient_id` / `box_id` columns.
- `src/app.py` — three-file upload form wired (`inputfile_file` added);
  registry stores `inputfile_filename`; delete + Regenerate-All paths
  updated; download filenames / page titles / results-dir path
  rebranded.
- `src/main.py` — rebranded.
- `templates/web/index.html`, `templates/web/settings.html`,
  `templates/report.html` — page titles, footer strings, GitHub link
  rebranded (link still points at legacy `mpox-luminex-qc` repo —
  flagged for Section 7).
- `README.md` + `SPECIFICATION.md` — top sections rebranded; bodies
  flagged "migration in progress" pending Section 7 rewrite.
- `UVIRA_TODO.md` — Sections 0 + 1 marked done / partial as appropriate.

**Smoke tests run:**
- `parse_xponent_csv()` on the pilot CSV: 200 analytes, 96 wells, batch
  + SN + panel name + Intelliflex program correctly captured. Plate ID
  resolved to `PLATE_05112026_RUN000`.
- `classify_wells()` on the parsed data: 10 PCs (Standard1..Standard10)
  with the correct dilution ladder 62.5 → 16,384,000; 2 NCs
  (`Background0` in A11/A12); 84 specimens.
- `build_layout()` joining `_inputfile.csv` × `RENAMED-Box1_Uvira_sera_2023.xlsx`:
  96 rows, 84/84 specimens get a patient ID, 12 control wells correctly
  empty.

**Known follow-ups (NOT done in Session 2 — explicit scope cut):**
- `report.py` still imports / renders kit-control + multi-pool +
  replicate-CV sections that no longer exist in the Uvira pipeline. The
  app will not produce a usable HTML report on Uvira data until
  Sections 3–5 land. The 4PL math itself (`qc_standard_curve.py`) is
  unchanged and ready to run.
- `qc_kit_controls.py`, `qc_nc.py`, `qc_replicates.py` not yet deleted;
  `pipeline.py` still calls them. Pipeline rewrite is part of Section 3+.
- GitHub repo URL in templates + README still points at the legacy
  repo path — flagged for Section 7.
- PyInstaller specs (`mpox-luminex-qc.spec`, `mpox-luminex-qc-win.spec`)
  not yet renamed.
- No unit tests written; testing is by-hand smoke tests only.

**Next session:** Section 2 (config / panel auto-derivation from the CSV
header, Settings-page wiring for the new fields) and Section 3 (standard
curves over 200 antigens + the "% in linear range" metric).

### Session 1 — 2026-05-13
- Reviewed the `uvira-luminex-qc` repo end to end (`src/*.py`, README,
  SPECIFICATION) and the OneDrive data drop (Intelliflex CSV, plate input
  file, 22 barcode-map xlsx files, dilution-series screenshot).
- Captured project context, mapped each existing module to reuse/edit/drop.
- Authored this `UVIRA_TODO.md` with the working plan and four open
  questions for the user.
- **User answers received** (same session):
  - Initial: dual-mode app accepted. **Reversed shortly after**: go
    single-mode Uvira 200-plex only; MPXV 12-plex MagPix support will be
    removed.
  - Excluded beads → **soft flag** (muted, not dropped).
  - IN/OUT-of-range table → **strictly binary**.
  - Barcode-map workflow → **manual upload** at submit time.
- **No code edits yet.** All open questions resolved. Next session:
  start on Section 0 (strip MPXV code, rebrand) and Section 1 (Intelliflex
  parser + manual upload of inputfile.csv and Box xlsx).
